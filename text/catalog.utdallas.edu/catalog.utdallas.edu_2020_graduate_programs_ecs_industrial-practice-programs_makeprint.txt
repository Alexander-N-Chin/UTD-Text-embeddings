Industrial Practice Programs
The Industrial Practice Programs (IP Programs or IPP) of the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science include the school's cooperative education, internship, and curricular practical training programs (ecs.utdallas.edu/studentservices/ipp/index.html). These programs combine classroom learning with paid work experience. Qualified students are referred to participating employers seeking candidates for career-related, pre-professional, and work assignments. The programs enhance a student's education and career preparation by integrating classroom theory with on-the-job performance; providing an understanding of work environments and professional requirements; testing career and professional goals; developing confidence, maturity, and skills in human relations; and establishing professional contacts and interests.
Students enroll in Engineering Computer Science Co-op (ECSC) courses during semesters when working on an IPP assignment. Students are expected to follow the rules of the IP Programs when working in a position titled by the employer as an internship or a cooperative education assignment.
For more information about the IP Programs, call 972-883-4363. The IP Programs are located in ECSS 2.502.
