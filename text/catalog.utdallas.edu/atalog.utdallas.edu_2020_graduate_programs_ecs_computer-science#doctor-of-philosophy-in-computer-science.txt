Objectives
The Graduate Program in Computer Science provides intensive preparation in the design, programming, theory, and applications of computers. The Department of Computer Science offers courses of study leading to the MS in Computer Science, the MS in Software Engineering, the PhD degree in Computer Science, and the PhD degree in Software Engineering. Training is provided for both academically oriented students and students with professional goals in the many business, industrial, or governmental occupations requiring advanced knowledge of computer theory and technology. Courses and research are offered in a variety of subfields of computer science, including operating systems, computer architecture, computer graphics, pattern recognition, automata theory, combinatorics, artificial intelligence, data and network security, natural language processing, database design, computer networks, programming languages, software systems, analysis of algorithms, computational complexity, software engineering, software testing, software reliability, scheduling, visualization, fault-tolerant computing, parallel processing, telecommunications networks, telecommunications software, performance of systems, VLSI, computational geometry, and design automation.
A comprehensive program of evening courses is offered which enables part-time students to earn the master's degree or to select individual courses of interest.
Facilities
The Department of Computer Science systems are comprised of a private virtualization cloud, several individual computer servers, computer workstations, and desktop computers. Research laboratories are available for parallel processing, distributed systems, software engineering, high-performance computing, graphics, programming languages and systems, telecommunications, CAD and graph visualization, image understanding and processing, artificial intelligence, big data, natural language processing, speech processing, and web technologies.

NOTE> Please be advised, the admissions section below feeds in from a separate page. Any changes made to the admissions section below will not be retained. Please contact catalog@utdallas.edu with any questions.
Admission Requirements
The University's general admission requirements are discussed on the Graduate Admission page.
The student entering the Computer Science MS program should have an undergraduate preparation equivalent to a baccalaureate in a quantitative science, including calculus and linear algebra. However, special arrangements (requiring more than the minimal number of semester credit hours) can be made for students with good undergraduate preparation in other fields. 
Minimum requirements are:

Bachelor's degree which includes 2 semesters of calculus and 1 semester of linear algebra.
A strong foundation in programming.
A GPA (grade point average) of at least 3.0 (last 60 semester credit hours). GPA in quantitative courses of at least 3.3.
GRE revised scores of 308, 153, 155, and 4 for the combined, verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing components, respectively, are advisable based on our experience with student success in the program.
Applicants are admitted on a competitive basis.

Students lacking undergraduate preparation in computer science must complete the courses listed below. At the discretion of the graduate advisor, a diagnostic exam may be required. The required prerequisite courses common to all master's students are:
Required Prerequisite Courses
CS 5303 Computer Science I
CS 5330 Computer Science II
CS 5333 Discrete Structures
CS 5343 Algorithm Analysis and Data Structures
CS 5348 Operating Systems Concepts
Substitution of CS 5303 and/or CS 5330 by professional experience will be considered.
Additional prerequisite courses required for the various degree plans are:
For the Data Sciences Track:
CS 3341 (SE 3341) Probability and Statistics in Computer Science and Software Engineering
For the Information Assurance Track:
CS 5390 Computer Networks
For the MS in Software Engineering:
CS 3354 (SE 3354) Software Engineering or SE 5354 Software Engineering
For the Networks and Telecommunications Track:
CS 3341 (SE 3341) Probability and Statistics in Computer Science and Software Engineering
CS 5390 Computer Networks
For the Traditional Computer Science:
CS 5349 Automata Theory
CS 5390 Computer Networks
Degree Requirements
The University's general degree requirements are discussed on the Graduate Policies and Procedures page.
The student may choose a thesis plan or a non-thesis plan. The thesis plan requires a minimum of 27 semester credit hours of courses, plus completion of an approved thesis (six thesis semester credit hours). This thesis is directed by a supervising professor and must be approved by the head of the Department of Computer Science. The non-thesis plan also requires a minimum of 33 semester credit hours of courses.
By a judicious planning of courses chosen from the computer science curriculum, supervised and approved by the graduate advisor, students may pursue the MS degree in Computer Science while emphasizing specific areas of the discipline. Students may also choose to receive the MS degree in Software Engineering. Because of the rapidly changing nature of the computer science discipline, the specific courses required may change by the time of the student's admission. A listing of the required courses will be specified by the student's advisor. Specific degree requirements follow.
