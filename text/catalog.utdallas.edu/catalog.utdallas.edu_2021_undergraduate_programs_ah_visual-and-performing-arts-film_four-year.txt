3
Students completing the 020 requirement with a MATH course must complete ALEKS exam prior to enrollment. PHIL 2303 does not require the ALEKS exam.

7
FILM Elective = FILM 3321, 3325, 3342, or 4V71. Of these 15 SCH, 9 SCH must come from the FILM 3321 and 3325.

9
VPA Elective = 3000 or 4000-level course from the prefix AHST, ARTS, COMM, DANC, FILM, MUSI, THEA, or VPAS.


10
