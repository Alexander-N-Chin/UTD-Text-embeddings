UT Dallas 2013 Undergraduate Catalog
School of Interdisciplinary Studies
American Studies (BA)
The program in American Studies focuses on the study of the cultures, institutions, legal system, political structure, and social processes of the United States. It emphasizes an interdisciplinary perspective. Students choose two broad areas or options to study.
American Studies graduates work in business, culture industries, government, legal fields, media, non-profit organizations, and sports industries. The BA in American Studies is also an excellent preparation for law school or graduate school. Each student designs his or her own program within specific guidelines and in consultation with an academic advisor. The courses a student takes as part of the American Studies program may be given in any school within the university but will include American Studies courses and appropriate Interdisciplinary Studies courses. A list of courses which apply to the American Studies degree may be obtained from the academic advisors in the School of Interdisciplinary Studies. Double majors including American Studies are encouraged.
