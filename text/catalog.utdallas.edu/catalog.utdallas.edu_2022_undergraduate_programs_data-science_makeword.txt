UT Dallas 2022 Undergraduate Catalog
Data Science (BS)
The Data Science BS is jointly offered by the Department of Mathematical Sciences in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and the Department of Computer Science in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science. Data Science is an emerging discipline that lies at the intersection of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics. The curriculum for the program provides a solid foundation in all the three disciplines. It prepares students for Data Scientist or related positions in industry, business, and government that are currently in high demand and also for graduate study in either of the three disciplines. The curriculum also includes a capstone project course.

III. Elective Requirements: 13-14 semester credit hours
Guided Electives: 13-14 semester credit hours
Although both lower- and upper-division courses may count as guided electives, they must be approved by the advisor and the student must complete at least 51 semester credit hours of upper-division courses to qualify for graduation.
NOTE: Students transferring into this program at the upper-division level are expected to have completed all of the 1000- and 2000- level Mathematics and Computer Science core course requirements.
1. Incoming freshmen must enroll and complete requirements of UNIV 1010 and the corresponding school-related freshman seminar course. Students, including transfer students, who complete their core curriculum at UT Dallas must take UNIV 2020.
2. Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
3. A required Major course that also fulfills Core Curriculum requirements. If semester credit hours are counted in the Core Curriculum, students must complete additional coursework to meet the minimum requirement for graduation. Course selection assistance is available from the undergraduate advisor.
4. Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted to fulfill the Mathematics Core Requirement with the remaining one semester credit hour to be counted under Component Area Option Core.
5. Six semester credit hours of Physics are counted under Science core, and one semester credit hour of Physics (PHYS 2125) is counted under Component Area Core.
6. Please consult your advisor if selecting Honors Physics.
7. Students may use three semester credit hours of PHYS 2421 to count under Science core, and one semester credit hour of PHYS 2421 under Component Area Option core.
8. BS in Data Science students can substitute MATH 2312 with MATH 2413.
9. MATH 2417 and MATH 2419 requirements can be fulfilled by completing MATH 2413, MATH 2414, and MATH 2415.
10. Students who complete PHYS 2421 do not need to complete PHYS 2125.
