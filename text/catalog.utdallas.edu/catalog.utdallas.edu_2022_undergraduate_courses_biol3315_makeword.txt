UT Dallas 2022 Undergraduate CatalogBIOL3315 - EpigeneticsBIOL 3315 Epigenetics (3 semester credit hours) Almost all cell types in our body share the same genetic information, but they perform very different functions. For example, our nerve cells are morphologically and functionally distinct from our muscle cells. How can the same genome give rise to hundreds of distinct cell types in our body? How can different diseases affect identical twins sharing the same genetic information? Why our parents and grandparents diet and health may have lasting influences in our own health? The field of epigenetics emerged over the past decades to tackle these fundamental questions that intersect our genome, development, environment and disease. This course will provide a broad overview of epigenetic phenomena and epigenetic mechanisms with weekly lectures and small group discussion of primary literature. The course will introduce students to seminal works in epigenetics and recent developments with the goal of instilling critical knowledge of the field. Prerequisites: (BIOL 3101 and BIOL 3301) or equivalent or instructor consent required. (3-0) Y
