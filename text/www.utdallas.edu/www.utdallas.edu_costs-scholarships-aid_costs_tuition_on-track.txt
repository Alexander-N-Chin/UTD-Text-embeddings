Graduation Help Desk
Undergraduates can get assistance from the Graduation Help Desk, a one-stop resource for undergraduate students who need assistance with roadblocks potentially hindering their ability to graduate on time. The Graduation Help Desk works with students, faculty, staff and advisors to resolve roadblocks. Funded by The University of Texas System for each of its eight academic institutions, the program aims to help undergraduates overcome obstacles to a timely graduation by connecting them to the right people and resources across campus.
SeekUT
SeekUT presents straightforward and understandable data that tells you what real graduates of The University of Texas System institutions are earning – based on campus and major – one, five, and ten years after graduation. It also tells you what Industries are employing graduates in Texas along with predicted job openings.
Additionally, SeekUT tells you what the median student loan debt is at graduation for those who took out loans, the percentage of students who borrowed, and the estimated monthly loan payment compared to median monthly earnings.
