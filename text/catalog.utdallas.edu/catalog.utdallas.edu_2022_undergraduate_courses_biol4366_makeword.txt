UT Dallas 2022 Undergraduate CatalogBIOL4366 - Molecular Biology of CancerBIOL 4366 Molecular Biology of Cancer (3 semester credit hours) Subject matter includes a discussion of representative examples of the principal categories of dominantly acting oncogenes. The role in oncogenesis of tumor suppressor genes ("recessive oncogenes") is also considered, as are anti-apoptotic oncogenes such as Bcl. The roles that the proteins encoded by these genes play in growth hormone signal transduction, gene regulation, cell cycle regulation, and programmed cell death will be examined. Students will also read and discuss the primary literature in this field. Prerequisite: BIOL 3302. (3-0) T
