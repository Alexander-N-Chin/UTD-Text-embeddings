UT Dallas 2020 Undergraduate Catalog
School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics
Geosciences (BS)
Attaining greater understanding of past and present Earth processes is the fundamental goal of geosciences. To achieve this goal the geoscientist studies the minerals, rocks, fluids, and fossils of the Earth and investigates the physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring on and in the Earth.
Professional opportunities in geology exist in the environmental, energy, and mineral resources industries and in government agencies concerned with these fields. In addition, many occupations concerned with law, management, economics, and the environment utilize a background in geosciences.
Specific degree plans will be formulated by the undergraduate advisor in Geosciences. Changing circumstances may require changes to the degree plans.

NOTE> Please be advised, the UTeach section below feeds in from a separate page updated by the UTeach team. Any changes made to the UTeach section below will not be retained.
UTeach Option
The UTeach option may be added to either the BA or BS degree. UTeach Dallas Option degree plans are streamlined to allow students to complete both a rigorous Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree and all coursework for middle or high school teacher certification in four years. Teaching Option degrees require deep content knowledge combined with courses grounded in the latest research on math and science education. While most graduates go on to classroom teaching, UTeach alums are also prepared to enter graduate school and to work in a discipline related industry.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees
The Fast-Track program allows students with strong academic records to take selected graduate courses that may be applied toward the baccalaureate degree and be used to satisfy requirements for the master's degree. Interested students who intend to pursue a master's degree in Geosciences may apply for a Fast Track baccalaureate/master's plan of study via the Geosciences graduate advisor. The planned coursework must be coordinated with the Geosciences undergraduate advisor; the Geosciences graduate advisor should also be notified. A maximum of 15 semester credit hours may be applied under this program.
 
1. Incoming freshmen must enroll and complete requirements of UNIV 1010 and the corresponding school-related freshman seminar course.  Students, including transfer students, who complete their core curriculum at UT Dallas must take UNIV 2020.
2. Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
3. A Major requirement that also fulfills a Core Curriculum requirement.
4. Three semester credit hours are counted to fulfill the Mathematics Core Requirement with the remaining semester credit hour to be counted under the major requirements.
5. Students who complete PHYS 2421 do not need to complete PHYS 2125.
