Undergraduate Policies and Procedures
Military
Military Service Activation Interruption of Education
From time to time, students who are reservists or members of the National Guard may be called to active duty in the U.S. military after a semester has begun. These students have several options for the treatment of their enrollment and tuition.
Military Training Awarded as Academic Course Credit
College Credit for Military Service
Military veterans who enroll at UT Dallas and meet certain requirements are eligible to receive undergraduate college credit for the time they spent in the service. Eligible veterans who enroll at the University receive college credit for up to twelve semester hours of lower division elective coursework. Eligibility requirements are defined in section 51.3042 of the Texas Education Code.
To be eligible to receive credit for military service, a veteran must:

Have graduated from a public or private high school accredited by a generally recognized accrediting organization or from a high school operated by the United States Department of Defense;
Have completed at least two years of service in the armed services (or have been discharged because of a disability); and
Have been honorably discharged from the armed forces.

Credit for military service is available to all entering undergraduates - those applying for transfer admission, freshman admission, or re-admission. The credit is awarded for having served, not for any college-level courses that the veteran may have taken while in the military. Admitted students who may qualify for credit for military service should speak with a representative of the Office of the Registrar upon enrollment at the University. The University of Texas at Dallas will consider whether to award lower-division (1000 or 2000 level) academic course credit toward a degree to admitted students when a student has provided the following documentation to the Office of the Registrar:

An official ACE military transcript submitted by the student to the Institution that describes the substance of the training completed by the student and verifies the student's successful completion of that training, as well as the recommended ACE credit to be awarded.
An official high school transcript from an accredited public or private high school or high school operated by the U.S. Department of Defense submitted by the student to the Institution indicating the student's official graduation.
The student's DD214 indicating that the student was honorably discharged AND completed at least two (2) years of military service OR was discharged because of disability.

All documentation must be submitted to The Office of the Registrar. The Office of the Registrar will notify the student regarding any approved credit prior to registration for the following semester. All decisions are final.
Option to Remain Enrolled and Complete Coursework Following Brief Military Service
Under certain circumstances, a student who is required to participate in active military service is excused from scheduled classes or other required activities and will be allowed to complete an assignment or exam within a reasonable time after the absence. The excused absence is permitted only if the student will miss no more than 25% of the total number of class meetings or the contact hour equivalent (not including the final examination period) for the specific course or courses in which the student is enrolled at the beginning of the period of active military service.
Option to Withdraw, Receive Incomplete Grade, or Receive Final Grade
A reservist or member of the National Guard called to active duty in the U.S. military who receives activation orders after the start of a semester has four other options for the treatment of tuition and fees paid to The University of Texas at Dallas and transcript notation. In accordance with Texas statutes and Coordinating Board rules, the student may request any one of the following:

The Office of the Registrar will process the withdrawal of the student from all classes and record "Withdrawn-Called to Military Duty" (WM) on the student's transcript and the Bursar Office shall refund the tuition and fees paid by the student for the semester in which the student withdraws; or
The Office of the Registrar may grant a student who is eligible under UT Dallas guidelines an incomplete grade (See "Incomplete Grades" section of the catalog for eligibility) in all courses by designating "Incomplete-Called to Military Duty" (XM) on the student's transcript. Please note: XM grades must be resolved within one year from the "release from active duty" date on military orders; or
The student may petition the instructor to assign an appropriate final grade or credit for the course after successfully completing a substantial amount of coursework and having demonstrated sufficient mastery of the course material; or
If the student withdraws before the Census Day of the semester in which the student is called to active military duty and the student requests Military Leave, courses will be dropped. Courses dropped on or before Census Day will not appear on the student's transcript.

NOTE: There are no provisions for refunds for active duty service members who are deployed as a result of military orders or for individuals who choose to enter the service. The provisions listed above apply only to reservists or members of the National Guard called to active duty.
Option for Automatic Readmission Following Military Service
A reservist or member of the National Guard called to active duty (not including routine National Guard training) may be readmitted without application or payment of additional application fees within one year of the "release from active duty" date on military orders. Applicable students will retain academic standing and financial eligibility if they meet current eligibility requirements other than continuous enrollment or other timing requirements.
