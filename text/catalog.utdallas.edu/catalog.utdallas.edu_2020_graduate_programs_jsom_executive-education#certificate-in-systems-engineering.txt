Admission Requirements
A student lacking undergraduate prerequisites for graduate courses must complete prerequisites or receive approval from the graduate advisor and the course instructor. Specific admission requirements for the Executive MS- SEM follow.
A student entering the MS-SEM program (Executive Education Master's) should meet the following guidelines:

A minimum of a BS in engineering, mathematics, physics, chemistry, economics or finance (specifically, programs that provide adequate fundamental skills in mathematics).
A minimum of three years of work experience.
Submission of three letters of recommendation from individuals who are able to judge the candidate's probability of success in pursuing a program of study leading to the MS-SEM degree.
Submission of an essay outlining the candidate's background, education, and professional goals.

Degree Requirements
The MS-SEM program is designed to be flexible to accommodate different student backgrounds, allowing students to pick up areas in which they are deficient, while still guaranteeing core competency in systems engineering and systems management. This program has both a thesis and a non-thesis option. All part-time MS-SEM students will be assigned initially to the non-thesis option. Those wishing to elect the thesis option may do so by obtaining the approval of a faculty thesis supervisor. Part-time students are encouraged to enroll in only one course during their first semester and in no more than two courses during any semester that they are also working full-time.
The MS-SEM degree requires a total of 36 semester credit hours consisting of 12 courses in the non-thesis option or 10 courses plus six semester credit hours of thesis credit for the thesis option. All students must have an academic advisor and an approved degree plan. Courses taken without advisor approval will not count toward the 36 semester credit hour requirement. Successful completion of the approved course of studies leads to the MS-SEM degree. Please note that the University's general degree requirements are discussed elsewhere in the graduate catalog.
This degree requires the completion of a minimum of 36 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses. For the four core courses, students must have a GPA of at least 3.0 and receive a grade of B- or better in each. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA overall to graduate with the MS-SEM degree. With advisor approval, one 5000 level course may be used in the concentration (See Course Requirements).
An alternative to 36 semester credit hours required for the MS-SEM degree, would be the completion of a minimum of 30 semester credit hours of graduate level lecture courses, with a grade of B- or better in each of the required core courses (see Course Requirements), six semester credit hours of a combination of master's research (SYSM 6V70) and thesis (SYSM 6V90), submitted to the graduate school, and a formal public defense of the thesis.
Students enrolled in the thesis option should meet with individual faculty members to discuss research opportunities and to choose a research advisor during the first or second semester that the student is enrolled. After the second semester of study, course selection should be made in consultation with the research advisor.
Research and thesis semester credit hours cannot be counted in an MS-SEM degree plan unless a thesis is written and successfully defended. A supervising committee, which must be chosen in consultation with the student's thesis advisor prior to enrolling for thesis credit, administers the defense. With advisor approval, the lecture courses may include some 5000 level courses. Full-time students at UT Dallas who receive financial assistance are required to enroll in nine semester credit hours each semester.
Course Requirements
Core Courses: 12 semester credit hours
Students are required to take four courses (a total of 12 semester credit hours) from the eight courses listed below. Two of the courses must be from the Engineering Core section and two from the Management Core section. The four required courses contribute a total of 12 semester credit hours toward the MS degree.
Engineering Core Courses
Choose two courses from the following:
SYSM 6301 Systems Engineering, Architecture and Design
SYSM 6302 Dynamics of Complex Networks and Systems
SYSM 6303 Statistics and Data Analysis

Management Core Courses
Choose two courses from the following:
SYSM 6311 Systems Project Management in Engineering and Operations
SYSM 6318 Marketing Management

Prescribed Electives: 12 semester credit hours
Students are required to take an additional four courses (a total of 12 semester credit hours) from the set of eight core courses listed above and/or the set of courses listed below. Two of these courses must be chosen from the two Engineering sections (core and elective), and two from the two Management sections (core and elective). Because a program objective is to maintain a high degree of flexibility, students are encouraged to work with an MS-SEM program advisor to discuss possible (limited) exceptions and substitutions for the prescribed elective courses.
Engineering Elective Courses
SYSM 6304 Risk and Decision Analysis
SYSM 6306 Engineering Systems: Modeling and Simulation
SYSM 6307 Linear Systems
SYSM 6308 Software Maintenance, Evolution, and Re-Engineering

SYSM 6320 Strategic Leadership
SYSM 6332 Technology and New Product Development
SYSM 6334 Systems Operations Management
SYSM 6335 Organizing for Business Analytics Platforms
Free Electives: 12 semester credit hours
Working with an MS-SEM program advisor, students are required to take four additional and distinct courses either from the remaining SYSM courses listed above or from other courses offered in management or engineering that form a "concentration" or "specialization" in systems-related, possibly industry-specific sectors.
The concentration area consists of four courses (12 semester credit hours) in the degree program; examples include: Aerospace and Defense Systems; Business and Data Analytics; Control and Mechatronic Systems, Cybersecurity and Information Assurance, Energy and Infrastructure Systems, Enterprise and Data Management Systems; Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management; Global Supply Chain Management; Healthcare Systems; Optimization and Operations Research; Telecom, IT and Multimedia Networks , and Transportation Systems.
Finally, because of the flexible nature of the MS-SEM degree program, students may submit for approval a "personalized" concentration area that focuses on aspects of systems engineering, and may combine elements of other concentration areas on a focused theme.

 
Certificate Programs in Systems Engineering and Management
The MS-SEM program offers two certificates: a Certificate in Systems Engineering and a Certificate in Systems Management, primarily intended for students who do not wish to pursue the complete MS degree. Each certificate requires 12 semester credit hours. See Course Descriptions for information on course content. These certificates allow students to fit their education into their busy schedules and pursue the track that best fits their career path. These flexible education programs provide students with outstanding opportunities to access UT Dallas' world-class faculty and hands-on learning experiences.
