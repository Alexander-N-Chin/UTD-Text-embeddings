UT Dallas 2013 Undergraduate CatalogBIOL4336 - Membrane BiologyBIOL 4336 Membrane Biology (3 semester hours) A survey of the structural components of biomembranes and the forces that dictate membrane structure. General membrane functions, such as compartmentalization and membrane transport, are analyzed in view of the principles of membrane structure. The structure, function, and biogenesis of the membrane organelles in cells are covered in detail. Diseases whose pathology originates with biomembranes, such as cystic fibrosis and heart disease, are discussed as examples illustrating membrane structure and function. Prerequisites: (BIOL 3301 and BIOL 3302) and (BIOL 3361 or CHEM 3361) and (BIOL 3362 or CHEM 3362) or their equivalents, or instructor consent required. (3-0) T
