Bachelor of Arts in Sociology




Sociology is a social science that involves the study of social behavior and interactions in family units, groups, organizations, institutions, communities and societies. Sociologists view the world through the lens of different cultures, social classes and social groups. The field trains students to use theoretical frameworks and scientific methods to examine questions about various aspects of social life such as workplace policies and corporate restructuring, the global economy, health and healthcare, religions and religious organizations, educational quality and achievement, technological changes and multi-cultural communication.
Careers in Sociology
Students seeking a degree in sociology will be equipped with critical skills necessary to succeed in a 21st-century workplace including critical thinking, analytic problem-solving, effective written and verbal communication, and an understanding of multicultural and global issues.
Few fields incorporate such a broad knowledge base, skill set and application to the social world. Sociology graduates often are employed in areas such as sales and marketing, human resources, social science and marketing research, nonprofit services and administration, education and public relations. Many sociology graduates also pursue professional and graduate degrees in law, social work, counseling, criminal justice, public administration, public policy and advanced degrees in sociology.
The University’s Career Center is an important resource for students pursuing their career. Licensed counselors are available to provide strategies for mastering job interviews, writing professional cover letters and resumes and help students connect with campus recruiters, among other services.
Sociology at UT Dallas
The mission of the BA program in sociology is to provide undergraduate students (both majors and non-majors) with broad knowledge of the theoretical concepts, empirical research findings and methodological approaches of the discipline of sociology, with an emphasis on theory and research related to social inequality. Sociology majors should gain mastery of these concepts, as well as develop skills for analysis of social structures, processes and institutions. At UT Dallas, sociology majors are encouraged to go beyond scholarly study to explore the ways that this area of study can be applied to business, government and nonprofit organizations.
Students are strongly encouraged to participate in an internship while in the sociology program. This will provide an opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge acquired through coursework in a work setting, as well as to expand valuable social network connections. The general BA degree requires 120 hours to graduate: 42 hours from the University’s core curriculum, 48 hours from the major and 30 hours of electives.
Fast Track
The Fast Track program enables exceptionally gifted UT Dallas students to include master’s level courses in their undergraduate degree plans. Students who meet the requirements for admission to graduate school and the minimum GPA requirement for their major can take up to 15 hours of graduate level coursework that can apply toward their undergraduate and graduate level coursework. To take graduate courses in the Fast Track program upper-division undergraduates must have completed 90 semester credit hours and petition their associate dean for permission to take graduate courses.
