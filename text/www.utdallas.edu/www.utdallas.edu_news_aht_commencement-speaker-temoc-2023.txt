Comedian, Designer of UTD Mascot To Deliver Commencement Address

Aaron Aryanpur BA’00 returned to campus for a tour with UT Dallas mascot Temoc after he was selected as the featured speaker for next month’s University Commencement. Aryanpur, who designed the first iteration of the UTD mascot, has performed as a stand-up comedian in clubs, theaters and colleges across the country for nearly 20 years.
Aaron Aryanpur BA’00 was taken aback a bit, but quite delighted, by how a creation he dreamed up 25 years ago has now become perhaps the biggest star at The University of Texas at Dallas.
“Hey, Temoc,” people shouted as Aryanpur recently toured his alma mater with the UT Dallas mascot. “I’m your biggest fan!” one cried. Sporting fiery orange hair and a wide perpetual grin, Temoc was silent but acknowledged every greeting with grand gestures.
“It’s like people are getting paid,” said Aryanpur, a renowned stand-up comedian who designed Blaze — the first iteration of Temoc — as a student in 1998. “I’ve been around a few celebrities in my life, and fans have elbowed me out of the way and asked me to hold their camera for a photo. Walking around campus with Temoc was oddly and awesomely similar.”


Aaron Aryanpur BA’00 drew Blaze — the first iteration of Temoc — for the UT Dallas mascot design contest in 1998.

Aryanpur, who majored in art and performance and literary studies, returned to campus after he was chosen to be the featured speaker at University Commencement on May 12. A focus group of students recommended him as a possible choice to UTD leadership.
The invitation has left him feeling honored — and nervous.
“I was more than surprised when they asked me,” he said. “My imposter syndrome kicked in immediately, and I assumed they were calling alumni alphabetically.”
Named the “Funniest Comic in Texas” in 2012, Aryanpur has performed in comedy clubs, theaters and colleges across the country for nearly 20 years. He made his national television debut on Fox’s “Laughs” and was a semifinalist in both Comedy Central’s “Up Next Talent Search” and NBC’s “Stand-Up for Diversity” competitions. His album “In Spite Of” made the Top 10 of both iTunes’ and Billboard’s comedy album charts.
Aryanpur, who also has been a contributing joke writer and a voice-over actor for a variety of programs, said he always felt like the job of commencement speaker was for someone who has all the answers.

Temoc’s 25th Birthday
Temoc’s 25th birthday will be celebrated April 20 on the Plinth during Earth Fair festivities. Mascots from the Dallas area have been invited to celebrate with Temoc and friends beginning at noon. The UT Dallas Power Dancers and Cheerleaders will perform, and there will be photo opportunities with Temoc.

“Spoiler alert: I don’t. However, I do have some lessons I’ve learned as a working artist and performer that I hope will resonate with the graduates,” he said.
His goal is to make the graduates feel celebrated.
“It’s an absolute honor to be asked, and I really want to deliver something meaningful to the University where so much of my life started,” he said.
Being back on campus after decades away, he noticed how much UTD has grown and changed over the years.
“The campus feels a little more tucked away now — a special place away from the rest of the city. I got the sense that the students have made it feel like a real home for themselves,” he said. “It was great revisiting old buildings. I lived on campus for two years, so a bunch of memories came flooding back.”
Aryanpur’s connection with Temoc — comet spelled backward —  began with a campuswide contest to design the University’s mascot. Aryanpur submitted drawings of a blue-skinned, comet character called Blaze and won the competition.

Why is Temoc blue-skinned?
“I was thinking as ‘icy’ as I could,” Aryanpur said. “And I liked the blue against the green and orange. They’re very tricky colors.”
Aryanpur remembered seeing the original Temoc suit being made out of foam at a costume shop.
“When we first brought the costume back to campus, they had me put on the top part,” he said. “It’s funny the way people react to you when you have muscles — even fake muscles.”
And his reaction to what Temoc means to Comets today?
“There’s a whole personality and culture that I couldn’t have imagined all those years ago. It is beautiful and surreal,” he said.
