Mpox (monkeypox)





Updated 12/1/22
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is tracking multiple cases associated with a recent outbreak of mpox that has been reported in several countries, including the U.S., and Dallas County. Due to the increase in cases, both the U.S. and Dallas County recently declared a Public Health Emergency. Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus. Mpox symptoms are similar to smallpox symptoms, but milder, and mpox is rarely fatal. According to the CDC, the general threat of mpox to the public is currently considered low.
Symptoms
FeverHeadacheMuscle aches and backacheSwollen lymph nodesChillsExhaustionRespiratory symptoms (e.g., sore throat, nasal congestion or cough)A rash that may be located on or near the genitals (penis, testicles, labia and vagina) or anus but could also be on other areas like the hands, feet, chest, face, or mouth.The rash will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing.The rash can look like pimples or blisters and may be painful or itchy.
Individuals with mpox may experience all or only a few of these symptoms. Most with mpox will develop rash or sores. Some people have reported developing a rash or sores before (or without) the flu-like symptoms. Mpox can be spread from the time symptoms start until the rash has healed, all scabs have fallen off and a fresh layer of skin has formed. The illness typically lasts two to four weeks.
