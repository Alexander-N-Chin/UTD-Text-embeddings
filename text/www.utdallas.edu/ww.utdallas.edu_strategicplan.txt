The University of Texas at Dallas has a story to tell. It’s a story still being written, sparked by the vision of our founders, and continuing half a century later.
Within this Strategic Plan is the collective vision of our community for the future of UT Dallas. It is our attempt to add to the story of this dynamic, young university and to point to the brilliant horizon before us. As we move forward, our gleaming future will benefit our community, our state, our nation, and yes, our world.
Thank you for your interest in UT Dallas.
