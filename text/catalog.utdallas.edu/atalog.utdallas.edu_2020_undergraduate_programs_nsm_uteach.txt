UTeach Dallas Options
Those interested in obtaining both a baccalaureate degree and a Teacher Certification in the state of Texas should consult the UTeach Dallas office for specific requirements as soon as possible after formal admission to the University.

The UTeach Dallas coursework may be added to either the BA or BS degree in specific disciplines within the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. UTeach Dallas degree plans are streamlined to allow students to complete both a rigorous Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree and all coursework for middle or high school teacher certification in four years; however, certain options may exceed minimum requirements for the degree. 
Teaching requires deep content knowledge combined with courses grounded in the latest research on math and science education. While most graduates go on to classroom teaching, UTeach Dallas alums are also prepared to enter graduate school and to work in discipline related industry.  Those that complete certification may add a Minor in Secondary STEM education to their degree showing their experience and expertise in teaching and learning. 
All UTeach Dallas students will follow the degree requirements set forth in the primary degree and take the following UTeach Dallas courses to meet the teacher certification criteria.

The Fast Track program involves taking selected graduate courses that can also count toward the student's undergraduate degree. After Fast Track admission to the graduate program, 15 semester credit hours of graduate courses with an earned grade of B or better can be used toward completion of the bachelor's degree and to satisfy requirements for those courses at the graduate level. Graduate courses must be approved by the graduate advisor. Interested students should contact the UTeach Dallas undergraduate advisor well in advance of the senior year to prepare a degree plan taking maximal advantage of this Fast Track program. Admission to Fast Track is not automatic. The student must work with the undergraduate and graduate advisors of the Science and Mathematics Education Department to submit an application for admission.
