This class is a more rigorous version of PHYS 2326. Derivations are more general and rely more heavily on multi-dimensional calculus concepts such as divergence, gradient, curl, and the theorems of Green, Stokes, and Gauss. More challenging problems and applications. Two lectures plus a required recitation session per week. Students will also be registered for an exam section. Prerequisites: (PHYS 2325 with a grade of B+ or PHYS 2421) and (MATH 2414 or MATH 2419). Corequisites: (MATH 2415 or MATH 2451 or MATH 3351) and PHYS 2126. (4-0) Y
