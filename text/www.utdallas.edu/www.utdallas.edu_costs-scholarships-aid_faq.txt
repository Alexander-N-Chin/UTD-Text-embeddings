FAQ





I would like to apply for financial aid. What application should I complete?
To determine whether you are eligible to apply for financial aid, visit the Financial Aid Eligibility page. Information regarding which application to complete is available on the Applying for Financial Aid page.
Do I need to be admitted before I can apply for financial aid?
You may apply for financial aid via the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA) as early as October 1 for the subsequent academic year; however, we cannot process your application until you are officially admitted to UT Dallas.
I completed my FAFSA a while ago but haven’t heard anything from UT Dallas. What should I do?
If you submitted your FAFSA to UT Dallas before you were admitted, the Office of Financial Aid will email your UT Dallas email account acknowledging receipt of your FAFSA about one to three days after you are admitted.
If you submit your FAFSA after you are admitted, it will take about 3 to 5 business days for the Office of Financial Aid to receive your FAFSA information from the Department of Education. Once we have received your FAFSA, we will email acknowledgment to your UT Dallas email account.
If you have been admitted and have not received an email to your UT Dallas email account acknowledging receipt of your FAFSA within the timeframes detailed above, you should check your FAFSA online to see if you listed our school code (009741) on it. If you have listed us, you should contact our office at financial-aid@utdallas.edu to request that we check your application status.
I received a financial aid offer. How do I accept/decline it?
Instructions regarding how to accept or decline your financial aid can be found on our Receiving Aid page.
I accepted my financial aid. When will it disburse?
Financial aid usually disburses on or about the first day of classes to your student account in the Bursar Office. The Bursar will use the funds to pay the charges on your account and, if a credit balance remains after the charges are paid, they will send you the remaining funds in the form of a refund. Detailed information about this process is available on the Disbursements and Refunds page.
My current financial situation is different from what was reported on my FAFSA. What should I do?
You may be able to request a special circumstance review. A special circumstance is an event that causes a loss or significant reduction in income or extremely high medical bills not paid by insurance. Special circumstance request forms can be found on the Financial Aid Forms page.
Do you offer financial aid during the summer? Will I have to complete a new FAFSA?
Students should complete a summer financial aid application to be offered financial aid for the summer semester. This form becomes available in March each year. Instructions on how to access the Summer Application for Financial Aid are available through the Financial Aid Forms page. If you completed a FAFSA or TASFA for the fall and/or spring semester preceding the summer, you do not need to complete another one for the summer.
Do I have to complete a new FAFSA every year?
Yes. Please visit the Deadlines page for financial aid priority deadline information.
Where can I find information regarding University Housing and meal plans?
The University Housing page has information regarding on-campus living options. The UTD Dining page contains information regarding a variety of meal plan options.
How do I pay my housing and/or meal plan charges?
You can view your University Housing and meal plan charges on your student account statement via the Bursar Office EZPay page. You may pay those charges directly to the Bursar Office using one of their various payment options.
What is EZPay?
EZPay is a Bursar Office website where you can manage your student account finances. Among the services available in EZPay are the ability to view your account balance, set up direct deposit, and enroll in a payment plan.
I have questions about my tuition bill. Who can I contact?
Contact the Bursar Office for information regarding tuition and related charges.
More information regarding financial aid FAQs and FAQs specific to veteran benefits are also available on the Office of Financial Aid website.
