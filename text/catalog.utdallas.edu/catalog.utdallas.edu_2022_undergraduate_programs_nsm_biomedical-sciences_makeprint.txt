School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics
Certificate in Biomedical Sciences
The post-baccalaureate Certificate in Biomedical Sciences (CBioMed) is offered through the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (NSM) and administered through the Health Professions Advising Center (HPAC). A rigorous curriculum allows students to further develop their scientific knowledge in preparation for application to schools of medicine, dentistry, or podiatry. Program requirements also include clinical, community service and/or research hours, independent from course credit and initiated by the student. Certificate students access HPAC services receiving assistance with the application process. 
Application for the program is through the ApplyTexas online application at www.utdallas.edu/admissions. Applicants apply as "Transfer, Undergraduate" students in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and select the "Undergraduate Certificate in Biomedical Sciences." A supplemental application, as well as the booklet "Information and Program Guidelines," can be found on the HPAC webpage. Please contact the HPAC office for deadlines in submitting the supplemental application.
Admission Requirements
Prospective students interested in enrolling in the Certificate in Biomedical Sciences program will be considered for admission based on the following standards:

met University admission requirements established for transfer undergraduate students;
earned a bachelor's degree from a U.S. college or university;
exhibited clear motivation for a career in medicine, dentistry, or podiatry (as evidenced by previous coursework, clinical exposure and/or a realistic plan for preparation);
completed the CBioMed program supplemental application; and,
earned an undergraduate grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.750.

Note: Competitive applicants for the CBioMed program should have completed, or be in the process of completing, an introductory sequence - for science majors - of chemistry, biology and physics.
Program Requirements
The certificate program is designed for students who are preparing for entrance into a medical, dental or podiatry school.
Requirements for completion of the Certificate in Biomedical Sciences program include:

A minimum of 24 post-baccalaureate undergraduate semester credit hours of approved courses at UT Dallas.
Of the 24 semester credit hours completed toward the certificate, a minimum of 9 semester credit hours must be HPAC advisor approved upper-division science courses.
In addition to the science courses, students must complete at least one course with content covering health disparities, professionalism, and/or ethics.
Completion of all admission prerequisite courses for the health profession schools to which the student will be applying.
A UT Dallas post-baccalaureate GPA of at least 3.300.
Evidence of at least 50 clock hours of approved clinical, community service and/or research activities documented according to program standards.
Completion of the Health Professions Evaluation (HPE) Process and recommendation by the HPAC Advisory Committee.

Curriculum
A variety of classes are available to students, depending on their particular needs and previous experience in undergraduate science courses. Students are required to work with an HPAC advisor in order to plan their curriculum for the program. HPAC advisors work with students to develop a curricular plan that is based on their individual circumstances, including past academic history and career goals. Courses that may be included to fulfill the certificate program requirements are listed below. Not all courses are taught every semester.
