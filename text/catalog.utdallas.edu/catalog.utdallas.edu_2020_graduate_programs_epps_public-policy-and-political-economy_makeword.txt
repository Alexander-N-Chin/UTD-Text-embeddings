Mission
The Mission of the Master of Public Policy is to offer students an interdisciplinary graduate education designed to develop skills for careers in which a solid understanding of the public policy process and the analysis and evaluation of public policies are essential. Students will be prepared for analytical and administrative positions and responsibilities in a wide array of professional settings in the public, nonprofit, and private sectors as well as advanced study for careers in research. Specific skills include knowledge of the policy process and related ethical concerns, rigorous research skills that provide students with an essential grounding in statistical and data analysis and research design, and effective communication skills.
Objectives

Students will understand and analyze the principal policy making institutions and the ways in which they formulate debate and implement public policies at the national, sub-national, and local levels. Students will examine legislative, executive, and non-governmental roles in policy formation at different levels of government. They will analyze the ways in which the various institutions interact and set policy priorities. They will study policy implementation and the interrelated functions of levels of governments, nonprofit and corporate entities in policy implementation.
Students will learn and apply quantitative skills and economic theories to measure and evaluate public policies. They will learn when to apply appropriate techniques to complex policies. They will demonstrate an understanding of techniques to examine the preferred outcomes of policy alternatives to advise senior officials. Students will acquire skills in applying statistical measures of projected policy outcomes. Students will learn economic theories and acquire skills in applying those theories appropriately to establish policy objectives and outcomes.
Students will understand the role of and learn appropriate, rigorous ways to design research to increase knowledge of public policy and citizen welfare. Students will learn ways to quantitatively and qualitatively design research projects that address important public policy questions and concerns.
Students will learn and understand the unique role of ethical theories and behavior as it applies to the public and nonprofit sectors. Students will understand the ethical obligation of elected and appointed governmental officials to the body politic. Students will understand the functions of internal and public oversight of the formation and implementation of public policies.
Students will develop expertise in a substantive area of public policy and learn how to effectively communicate new findings and innovative policies to senior decision makers and the general public. Students will study one of three major public policy disciplines - social policy, health policy or the business-government relationship. Students will understand the theories and scientific principles that support these substantive policy areas and the ways in which those theories are tested. Students will understand how these policy areas contribute to the well-being of citizens to enhance the quality of life.
Qualified students are encouraged to consider the PhD in Public Policy and Political Economy (PPPE). Such students should meet with Program Head or Director of Graduate Studies of PPPE as soon as possible to discuss options.

However, students should check with the Director of the Certificate Program or the program office for details as to the list of acceptable courses.
Students seeking the certificate who do not plan to seek a degree should (1) submit an application and (2) an undergraduate transcript. No GRE score is required. Note: (a) up to 15 semester credit hours of coursework taken as a non-degree seeking student can be applied later to a graduate degree; (b) currently enrolled students may use up to 9 semester credit hours of courses required for their degree for the certificate. Non-degree seeking students interested in continuing their graduate education must formally apply to the University and their program of interest to be considered for admission.
Courses for the certificate must be completed within a 3-year period with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0.
Â 
Graduate Certificate in Program Evaluation
15 semester credit hours
A graduate-level certificate program in Program Evaluation is offered by the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences. Students who complete this program have an opportunity to gain competencies in the design and implementation of program evaluations in fields such as education, health care, human services, criminal justice, and economic development. The Certificate in Program Evaluation may be incorporated into graduate degree programs in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences, or may be taken independently by non-degree seeking students. Students pursuing the certificate program are normally expected to have completed undergraduate courses in statistics and in research methods. Students lacking appropriate preparation may be asked to take needed courses prior to admission to the program.
In order to receive the certificate, students must successfully complete a total of 15 semester credit hours of focused study, comprising of three required courses in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences (9 semester credit hours) and 6 semester credit hours of field practice.
