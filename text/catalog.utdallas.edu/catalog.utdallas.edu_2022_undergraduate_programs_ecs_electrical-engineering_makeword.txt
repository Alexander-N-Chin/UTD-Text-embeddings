Degree programs in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science are governed by various accreditation boards that place restrictions on classes used to meet the curricular requirements of degrees they certify. For this reason, not all classes offered by the University can be used to meet elective requirements. Please check with your academic advisor before enrolling in classes you hope to use as free electives.
Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees
In response to the need for advanced education in electrical engineering, a Fast Track program is available to well-qualified UT Dallas undergraduate students. Qualified seniors may take up to 15 graduate semester credit hours that may be used to complete the baccalaureate degree and also to satisfy the requirements for the master's degree. This is accomplished by (1) taking courses (typically electives) during one or more summer semesters, and (2) beginning graduate coursework during the senior year. Details are available from the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education.
Honors Program
The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers Departmental Honors for outstanding students in the BS Electrical Engineering degree program. Admission to the Honors programs requires that the student meet the following qualifications:

Has repeated no more than 3 courses at UT Dallas and has repeated no course more than once.

Graduation with Honors requires a 3.500 or better GPA and completion of either Senior Honors in Electrical Engineering (EE 4399) or Undergraduate Research in Electrical Engineering (EE 4V98). A Senior Honors Thesis must be completed within one of those two classes. (While the topics may be related, the Senior Thesis does not replace the need for the student to complete a regular Senior Design Project).
Departmental Honors with Distinction may be awarded to students whose Senior Honors Thesis is judged by a faculty committee to be of exemplary quality. Only students graduating with Departmental Honors are eligible. Thesis/projects must be submitted by the deadline that applies to MS Theses in the graduating semester to allow for proper evaluation. Students interested in Honors with Distinction are encouraged to start working on their thesis/project a year prior to graduation.
Minors
The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering does not offer minors at this time.

1. Incoming freshmen must enroll and complete requirements of UNIV 1010 and the corresponding school-related freshman seminar course. Students, including transfer students, who complete their core curriculum at UT Dallas must take UNIV 2020.
2. Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
3. Semester credit hours fulfill the communication component of the Core Curriculum.
4. Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted under Mathematics Core, and five semester credit hours of Calculus are counted as Component Area Option Core.
5. Six semester credit hours of Physics (PHYS 2325 and PHYS 2326) are counted under Science Core and one semester credit hour (PHYS 2125) is counted under the Component Area Option Core.
6. Students must pass each of the EE, CS, Math and Science courses listed in this degree plan and each of their prerequisites, with a grade of C- or better.
7. Transfer students with sufficient background may petition to substitute upper-division semester credit hours in the major for this class.
