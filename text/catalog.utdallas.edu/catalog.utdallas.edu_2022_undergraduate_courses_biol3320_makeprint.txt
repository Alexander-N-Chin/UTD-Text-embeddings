UT Dallas 2022 Undergraduate CatalogBIOL3320 - Applied GeneticsBIOL 3320 Applied Genetics (3 semester credit hours) Genetic model organisms such as the flatworm (Planaria), fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster), nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), and the zebrafish (Danio rerio) are the cornerstones of biomedical research. These organisms known for their simplicity of structure and gene similarity to humans have been seminal in advancing our understanding of many biological processes and human diseases. In this inquiry-based course, learners will apply basic principles of genetic model systems, transmission genetics, and molecular genetics to investigate important biological concepts such as embryonic cell division, stem cells and regeneration, Mendelian inheritance, gene mutations, and phenotypes. Throughout this exploratory course, students will gain practical hands-on experience conducting basic culturing, genetic manipulation and phenotypic analysis necessary to utilize genetic model organisms in their investigation. Learners will engage in class discussions and activities to draw connections between the concepts learned in class and their real-time application(s) in biomedical sciences. Prerequisites: BIOL 2281 or equivalent and (BIOL 2311 and (BIOL 2111 or equivalent)) and (BIOL 2312 and (BIOL 2112 or equivalent)). (3-0) S
