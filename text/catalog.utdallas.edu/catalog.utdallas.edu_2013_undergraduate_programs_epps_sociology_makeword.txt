Sociology (BA)
Sociology offers a scientific approach to examining social groups, human interactions and social change. Sociologists are interested in a wide range of topics and issues related to social life. Some examples of sociological questions include: Why do some groups have more resources and power than others in society and what explains these inequalities? What factors influence marriage and divorce rates? How do families, schools, churches, and corporations affect social control? What are the functions of welfare programs? How do cities grow and transform to reflect changing technologies and population trends? How does law interact with society and social institutions? What are the causes and consequences of crime and deviant behavior?
The mission of the BA in Sociology is to provide undergraduate students (both majors and non-majors) with broad knowledge of the theoretical concepts, empirical research findings, and methodological approaches of the discipline of sociology, with an emphasis on theory and research related to social inequality. As part of this program, sociology majors should gain mastery of these concepts, findings, and approaches central to sociology, as well as develop basic skills in empirical analysis and professional communication.
At UT Dallas, sociology majors are encouraged to go beyond scholarly study to explore ways that sociology can be utilized in corporations, government agencies, or voluntary organizations. Sociology graduates of the university have pursued careers or graduate study in a variety of areas including policy research, social services, business, law, education, law enforcement, and other social sciences.
