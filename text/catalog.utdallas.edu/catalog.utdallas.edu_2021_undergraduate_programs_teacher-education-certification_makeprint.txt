Undergraduate Programs
Teacher Education Certification Preparation Programs
UT Dallas offers rigorous university-based teacher certification curricula and enjoys an outstanding reputation for producing excellent teachers.
At UT Dallas, coursework and field experiences leading to teacher certification may be accomplished through either the Teacher Development Center (TDC) program in the School of Interdisciplinary Studies (972-883-2730) or through UTeach Dallas program in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics (NS&M) (972-883-2496). In coordination with a student's academic major in other UT Dallas academic programs, students develop the content expertise required in a teaching field such as Early Childhood Education, Literature, History, Mathematics, and Science. Both programs utilize the total resources of the University rather than relying on a school of education. Students interested in pursuing teacher certification through UT Dallas should review program requirements for the TDC and UTeach Dallas. Although each program provides the same curricular content as required by the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC) and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB), the programs are uniquely independent, not interchangeable, and differ in course design and some requirements. Both SBEC and THECB have approved the content and procedures for both programs' curricula.
UT Dallas undergraduate and graduate students may earn their teaching certificates concurrently with their degree studies. Also, through the UTeach Dallas program, undergraduate students can earn a minor in STEM education along with their content degree. Additionally, graduate students may choose to pursue teacher certification without formal degree studies as a non-degree seeking graduate student in the School of Interdisciplinary Studies or in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics. The Master of Arts in Teaching programs in Science Education and Mathematics Education have been streamlined to work with UTeach Dallas teacher certification.
After developing a degree plan with their academic major advisor, undergraduate students may apply to the TDC for admission to the teacher certification program. A certification plan will be developed with the student and the TDC advisor. Students enrolling in UTeach Dallas should meet with the UTeach Dallas advisor who also serves as an NS&M academic advisor. Post baccalaureate students seeking their teacher certification may be advised in the TDC or UTeach Dallas.
For those students who wish to pursue a future in the field of Education, UT Dallas offers both a Bachelor's of Arts in Education and a Bachelor's of Science in Education through the School of Interdisciplinary Studies.
Certification Subject Areas
There are two possible tracks to teacher certification at UT Dallas. The TDC offers and supports preparation for teacher certification in numerous teaching fields and grade levels. UTeach Dallas specializes in the preparation and support of secondary mathematics, computer science, and science certifications.
Secondary (Grades 7-12) Certification
Undergraduate students in either certification track must have an academic major and a minimum of 24 semester credit hours of appropriate coursework in their chosen teaching field as well as a reading course (for TDC) in secondary content, and 18 semester credit hours of professional education including clinical teaching. Students may be enrolled in the School of Interdisciplinary Studies, the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, or in the school of their academic degree major. All teacher candidates must pass state required TExES examinations in Pedagogy and Professional Responsibilities as well as the content exam for their chosen teaching field prior to clinical teaching. Certification for secondary education is offered in the following content areas/teaching fields:

7-12 English Language Arts and Reading (ELAR)1
7-12 History1
7-12 Social Studies1
8-12 Computer Science1
7-12 Mathematics2
7-12 Chemistry2
7-12 Life Sciences2
6-12 Physical Sciences2
7-12 Science2

Secondary (Grades 4-8) Certification
Undergraduate students in either certification track must have an academic major and a minimum of 24 semester credit hours of appropriate coursework in their chosen teaching field as well as 18 semester credit hours of professional education including clinical teaching. Additionally, students must complete state-required reading content for either certification track (TDC or UTeach Dallas). Students who wish to seek teacher certification in grades 4-8 may choose "4-8 Core Subjects" or select a specialized teaching field. Students may be enrolled in the School of Interdisciplinary Studies, the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, or in the school of their academic degree major. All teacher candidates must pass state required TExES examinations in Pedagogy and Professional Responsibilities as well as the content exam for their chosen teaching field prior to clinical teaching. Teacher certification for grades 4-8 is offered in the following content areas/teaching fields:

4-8 Science2
4-8 Mathematics2
4-8 Social Studies1
4-8 English Language Arts and Reading (ELAR)1
4-8 Core Subjects1, 3, 4

Early Childhood - Grade 6 Core Subjects Certification
The "Core Subjects EC-6" teacher certificate may only be earned through the TDC certification track. It is the only certification available to students interested in these grade levels. The TExES content examination for this certification tests for broad-based content mastery. Therefore, students are counseled to work with academic advisors in the School of Interdisciplinary Studies or the School of Brain and Behavioral Sciences if they seek "Core Subjects EC-6" certification. Because most school districts now seek or require EC-6 teachers to have ESL or bilingual supplemental certification, the TDC highly recommends students seeking this certification to prepare for and take the ESL Supplemental TExES examination when certified by TEA.  Students seeking certification in EC-6 Core Subjects must pass the state required TExES examination, the Science of Teaching Reading.
1. Available only through the Teacher Development Center (TDC).
2. Available through the TDC or UTeach Dallas teacher certification tracks.
3. Students seeking certification in 4-8 ELAR or 4-8 Core Subjects must pass the state required TExES examination, The Science of Teaching Reading.
4. Because the 4-8 Core Subjects certificate qualifies a candidate to teach multiple content areas, additional academic coursework is required to prepare candidates for the rigorous broad-based TExES "Generalist 4-8" examination.
All Teaching Fields
All undergraduate students in either certification track must meet the 42-semester credit hour core curriculum for The University of Texas at Dallas.
All students seeking fulfillment of certification requirements through the TDC certification track are required to pass 18 semester credit hours of appropriate professional education courses, including six semester credit hours of full-day clinical teaching. The state of Texas requires specific reading content for each certification level. Candidates must also demonstrate technology literacy, online education literacy, and effective public speaking.
All candidates seeking fulfillment of certification requirements through the UTeach Dallas certification track are required to pass 18 semester credit hours of appropriate professional education courses, including six semester credit hours of full-day clinical teaching. Candidates must also complete Perspectives in Math and Science or an approved equivalent and meet the requirements of the Texas Success Initiative (TAC Title 19, Part 1, Chapter4, Subchapter Rule §4.54) to assure college readiness and English proficiency as part of the admission criteria.
Admission
Upon admission to the University, undergraduate students should meet with an academic advisor in their major field to develop their degree plan indicating to the academic advisor they plan to seek teacher certification. NS&M and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) undergraduate students seeking teacher certification preparation through UTeach Dallas should meet with the UTeach Dallas academic advisor to prepare their degree plan. Both the TDC and UTeach Dallas require all students to have a 2.750 GPA.
Post-Baccalaureate/Graduate Students
Students with a baccalaureate degree may seek teacher certification. Post-baccalaureate students should consult with a TDC or UTeach Dallas advisor to develop a certification plan after their admission to the University through the Office of Admission and Enrollment. Prior to admission to a post-baccalaureate certification program, students must meet the program standards based on meeting the requirements of the Texas Success Initiative (TAC Title 19, Part 1, Chapter4, Subchapter Rule §4.54) or GRE.
Post-baccalaureate students must meet the 24 semester credit hour requirements for their chosen content area and required professional education coursework. A certification plan based on an analysis of the candidate's transcript will be developed. If additional content coursework is necessary, the candidate may take the required courses in their content area at the graduate or undergraduate level. Candidates must demonstrate technology literacy, online education literacy, and effective public speaking. TDC students must complete a total of 12 semester credit hours of English language, composition, and/or literature. All candidates must fulfill requirements for clinical teaching or supervised internship.
Post-Baccalaureate/Graduate Students with Degrees from Another Country
Students with a 4-year baccalaureate and/or graduate degree from another country must have that degree(s) evaluated by a foreign credential evaluator service. Neither UT Dallas nor the TDC nor UTeach Dallas accredit or formally approve credential evaluation services. Students may go to tea.texas.gov/Texas_Educators/Certification/Out-of-State_Certification/Foreign_Credential_Evaluation_Services to find a list of reviewed foreign credential evaluator providers who completed an application affirming they follow the standards of recognized national organizations of foreign credential evaluators. Students must provide official copies of their transcripts to UT Dallas.
Students from non-English speaking countries whose primary language is NOT English are required to take all 4 sections of the TOEFL (the only approved test). Texas Education Agency requires applicants to score a 26 on the Speaking section. To register for TOEFL, please log in to the ETS website www.ets.org.
To be exempt from TOEFL, the primary language of instruction in your university must have been English. Documentation for exemption eligibility must be on official letterhead of the university, stating that their primary language of instruction is English.
Guidelines for Admission to The University of Texas at Dallas Teacher Certification Programs
Guidelines are in compliance with Chapter 227 of the Texas Administrative Code and the HEA Title II accountability requirements.
Students seeking Texas teaching credentials at UT Dallas must meet the following requirements:

GPA of 2.750 overall or on the last 60 semester credit hours of coursework.
All students must have completed 12-15 semester credit hours in major/teaching field with no grade lower than a "C."
Post-Baccalaureate students must have an undergraduate or graduate degree from an accredited university. If a student holds a degree from an accredited college or university, and has never enrolled in an Educator Preparation Program (EPP), the student may qualify to register for a Pre-Admission Content Test (PACT). Detailed PACT information is available on the ETS website. Taking PACT does not ensure admittance into an Educator Preparation Program. Programs may have additional admission requirements. Post-Baccalaureate students must meet the requirements of the Texas Success Initiative (Texas Education code 51.3062), meet the GRE requirements below or otherwise be determined by the program.
GRE: A minimum Verbal score of 450 and a minimum Quantitative score of 450 for a combined Verbal/Quantitative minimum score of 900 and a writing score of 3 or higher. Revised 2012 GRE Scoring: Minimum Verbal score of 135 and a minimum Quantitative score of 135 for a combined Verbal/Quantitative minimum score of 270 and a writing score of 3 or higher. (GRE scores can be no more than five years old.)
TSI - Exempt or Complete or as otherwise determined by the program.

Undergraduate students enrolling in the TDC program should meet with a faculty advisor in their academic major to develop a degree plan no later than the end of the second regular semester following the semester in which the student earned 45 or more semester credit hours, per the Texas Education Code, Section 51.9685, indicating to the advisor their interest in pursuing teacher certification. Students can then make an appointment for certification plan advising with the TDC whenever they are ready to take upper-division courses.
Undergraduate students enrolling in UTeach Dallas or all students (including freshmen) interested in exploring or pursuing secondary mathematics, computer science, or science teaching as a career are encouraged to enroll in UTeach Dallas certification coursework as early as their first semester at UT Dallas due to early field and teaching experiences as well as compacting degree plans with certification preparation.
