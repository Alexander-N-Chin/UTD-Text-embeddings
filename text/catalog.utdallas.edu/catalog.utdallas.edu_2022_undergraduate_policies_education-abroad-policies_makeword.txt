Education Abroad Policies
Information about education abroad opportunities is available at the International Center, Student Services Building (SSB) 3.400. Students are required to satisfy the University's international travel requirements with the guidance of Education Abroad. The advising process includes university policies governing education abroad application, selection procedures, funding sources, international health insurance, emergency procedures, and liability issues, among other aspects. Information is also disseminated through special events, group meetings, individual appointments, reference materials, and at the Education Abroad website (ic.utdallas.edu/ea).
Education Abroad Options
Students may participate in the following types of education abroad programs:

Faculty-led Programs: Students register for UT Dallas coursework that includes international components as a part of the UT Dallas curriculum. Students are assessed UT Dallas tuition and fees for the faculty-led course semester credit hours. Additional fees are assessed to cover program costs.
Reciprocal Exchange: Students are registered for full time reciprocal exchange courses at UT Dallas, but pursue the academic program at a foreign institution with which UT Dallas has an active reciprocal exchange program agreement. Students may select from a variety of reciprocal exchange institutions and arrange for transfer of credit to UT Dallas. Students are assessed UT Dallas tuition and fees for the reciprocal exchange courses, and may apply their Academic Excellence Scholarships toward these programs.
Internships: To pursue an internship in a foreign destination, students must report the internship through the Handshake system for a review and approval by the University Career Center and the academic department. Students are registered for the UT Dallas internship course and are assessed UT Dallas tuition and fees for the corresponding semester credit hours.
Approved Affiliated Programs: Students are registered for study abroad courses at UT Dallas, but pursue the academic program with an organization or institution specialized in designing academic courses for U.S. students in foreign destinations. Students may select from a variety of affiliated programs and arrange for transfer of credit to UT Dallas. Students are responsible for paying program fees directly to the affiliated provider, and are not charged UT Dallas tuition for the study abroad course. Students may not apply their Academic Excellence Scholarships toward these programs.
Independent Study: Students are registered for and pursue UT Dallas academic coursework in a foreign destination under UT Dallas faculty supervision and with the approval of the appropriate academic department. Students are assessed UT Dallas tuition and fees for the independent study semester credit hours.
Academic Research: A non-credit opportunity (research, service learning, language intensive study) that allows for personal growth, sponsored by UT Dallas. University travel guidelines apply, even if credit will not be earned.

Eligibility and Conditions

A student must be in academic good standing to participate in all abroad programs, and disciplinary records will be used in determining student's eligibility.

Students who are within the jurisdiction of the 24/30 rule and plan to graduate must obtain a waiver from the Dean of Undergraduate Education to be eligible for Education Abroad programs.
