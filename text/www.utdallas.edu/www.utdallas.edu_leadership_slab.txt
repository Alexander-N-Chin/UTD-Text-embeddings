Student Leadership Advisory Board (SLAB)
The Student Leadership Advisory Board is a committee of students who help shape and
                implement all of the SLP's leadership programming. These students are trained on the ins and outs of the
                Student Leadership Challenge and are excited to work with you or your student organization.
