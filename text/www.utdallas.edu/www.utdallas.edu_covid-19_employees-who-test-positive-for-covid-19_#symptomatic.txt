Updated 9/7/22
Employees are responsible for informing their supervisors of any absences. Employees who are also taking classes are responsible for notifying their instructor(s) of any absences and working with their faculty regarding missed class/work during isolation. For absences due to COVID-19, report a positive COVID-19 diagnosis via the UT Dallas self-report form (English or Spanish).
Individuals should follow current CDC guidance for their specific situation. Employees may need to use available accrued leave for all or part of the illness or isolation period if unable to perform duties. As with other illnesses, supervisors are encouraged to work with employees to determine the best course of action regarding their absence.
Positive for COVID-19: Isolation Guidelines
Regardless of vaccination status, UT Dallas employees should follow these guidelines for isolation:

Stay home for five full days after your symptoms begin (day one is the first full day after your symptoms began). For asymptomatic individuals, isolate for five full days since your positive test date (day one is the first full day after you tested).
If you have no symptoms or your symptoms are much improved after five full days and you have been without a fever for at least 24 hours (without the use of medication), you can leave your house wearing a well-fitting, high-quality mask around others for five full additional days.
If you did not initially have symptoms but develop some within 10 days of when you tested positive, your isolation period restarts at day zero on the day of symptom onset and you should isolate five full days after symptoms begin.
Avoid being around people who are most at-risk until at least day 11. Consider taking an at-home test after a recent infection before you visit medically frail individuals as an extra precaution.
When you leave isolation, you should wear a well-fitting, high-quality mask consistently and correctly around others for five full additional days (through day 10).
You may be able to discontinue masking sooner than day 10. If you are fever-free for at least 24 hours and your symptoms are either gone or much improved by day six, then test at home. Test at home again 48 hours later (on day eight). If both test results are negative, you may discontinue masking in public. If either test result is positive, continue masking and testing every 48 hours, until you have two consecutive negative test results within a 48-hour period. Once that has occurred, you may discontinue testing and masking. Be aware, by using this method, you may end up masking and testing beyond day 10.
If you have a fever on or after day five, continue to isolate until you are fever-free for 24 hours (without the aid of fever-reducing medication).
If you had moderate illness (if you experienced shortness of breath or had difficulty breathing), or severe illness (you were hospitalized) due to COVID-19, or you have a weakened immune system, you need to isolate through day 10.
If you have severe COVID-19 symptoms on or after day five, please consult with a health care provider.

Close Contacts
If you have been exposed to COVID-19, regardless of your vaccination status or your previous infections, start taking precautions immediately. You should wear a well-fitting, high-quality mask consistently and correctly as soon as you find out you have been exposed. The day of your last contact with COVID-19 is day zero. You should mask for 10 full days after day zero. Do not go where you cannot wear a mask and take extra precautions if you must be around people who are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19. Monitor yourself for symptoms; they can develop up to 10 days after your exposure. If you develop symptoms, isolate immediately, get tested, and follow the symptomatic or positive guidance. Five full days (on day six) after your last exposure, get tested. You can take an at-home, rapid or PCR test. If you test negative, continue taking precautions and wear your mask consistently and correctly for the full 10 days after your exposure. If you test positive, either with or without symptoms, please isolate immediately and follow the positive guidance.

Please review the CDC web page for more information on what to do if you are exposed to COVID-19.
For more information on what to do if you are experiencing symptoms, please isolate immediately and visit the CDC Quarantine and Isolation Calculator.

Symptomatic Individuals
Regardless of vaccination status, all individuals who experience COVID-19-like symptoms should isolate immediately, wear a mask and get tested. You should isolate until you have the results of your COVID-19 test. If you test positive, please follow the positive guidance. Please keep in mind a negative at-home or rapid test does not rule out a COVID-19 infection; it may be that you tested too early to detect the virus. Continue masking consistently and correctly. Test again with an at-home test 48 hours after your first negative test. If you get a negative result on the second test (again taken 48 hours after your first negative) and you are still concerned that you could have COVID-19, you may take another at-home test again 48 hours after the second test, consider getting a PCR test or contact your health care provider. The FDA recommends repeating this procedure (testing again 48 hours after your previous test) for a total of at least three (consecutively negative) tests to reduce the risk of a false negative result.
Please report your positive results to campus using the Positive Self Report Form (English or Spanish).

Please review the CDC web page for more information on what to do if you are exposed to COVID-19.
