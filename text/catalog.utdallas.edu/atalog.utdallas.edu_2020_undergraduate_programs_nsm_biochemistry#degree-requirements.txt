UT Dallas 2020 Undergraduate Catalog
School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics
Biochemistry (BS)
The Biochemistry program at UT Dallas, administered through the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, draws on faculty from the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, and researchers from UT Southwestern Medical School to provide courses and research opportunities to its majors. The Biochemistry major bridges the gap between modern Chemistry and Biology. The curriculum, designed to prepare students for either graduate work in the Biological Sciences, the Chemical Sciences, or for entry-level positions in the biotechnology industry, builds on a base of biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics to provide the student the opportunity to develop essential theoretical and practical skills.
UT Southwestern Medical School
UT Dallas Biochemistry majors may perform their research in the laboratories of faculty members from the departments of Biochemistry, Internal Medicine, Pharmacology and Physiology at UT Southwestern, as available.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees
Undergraduate students at UT Dallas with strong academic records who intend to pursue the MS in Chemistry at UT Dallas may apply for a Fast Track plan of study which involves taking selected graduate courses as an upper-level student. After Fast Track admission to the graduate program, 15 semester credit hours of graduate courses with an earned grade of B or better can be used toward completion of the baccalaureate degree and to satisfy requirements for the master's degree. Interested students should contact the undergraduate advisor well in advance of the junior year to prepare a sequence permitting maximal advantage to be taken of the catalog's regulations (see Undergraduate Registration for Graduate Courses).
 
1. Incoming freshmen must enroll and complete requirements of UNIV 1010 and the corresponding school-related freshman seminar course.  Students, including transfer students, who complete their core curriculum at UT Dallas must take UNIV 2020.
2. Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
3. A required Major course that also fulfills Core Curriculum requirement. Semester credit hours are counted in the Core Curriculum.
4. Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted to fulfill the Mathematics Core Requirement with the remaining one semester credit hour to be counted under Component Area Option Core.
5. Six semester credit hours of Chemistry are counted under Science core, and one semester of Physics (PHYS 2125) are counted under Component Area Option core.
6. Students may use PHYS 2421 as part of the component area core curriculum requirement instead of PHYS 2125 if they choose that Physics sequence.
7. Indicates a prerequisite class to be completed before enrolling for upper-division classes.
8. Students will take one of the two Physics sequences: PHYS 2325 and PHYS 2326 or PHYS 2421 and PHYS 2422 with accompanying labs.
9. Students who complete PHYS 2421 do not need to complete PHYS 2125.
