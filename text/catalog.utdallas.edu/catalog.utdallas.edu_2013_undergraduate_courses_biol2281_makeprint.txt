UT Dallas 2013 Undergraduate CatalogBIOL2281 - Introductory Biology LaboratoryBIOL 2281 Introductory Biology Laboratory (2 semester hours) Introductory lectures discuss the theoretical and historical aspects of the experiments carried out in the laboratory. Laboratory experiments introduce the student to bioinformatics, basic cellular biology, and structure and function of proteins and nucleic acids. Computer exercises in bioinformatics involve multiple alignment analyses, BLAST and literature searches, and construction of phylogenetic trees. Laboratory experiments include microscopy, microbial techniques, yeast genetics, and the electrophoretic behavior of normal and mutant proteins. DNA related experiments include isolation (nuclear and mtDNA), amplification, restriction digests, electrophoresis, plasmid mapping, and transformations. Students present posters of their long-term investigations at the end of the semester. Prerequisite: BIOL 2311 (also see prerequisites for BIOL 2311). ([0-1]-[1-2]) S
