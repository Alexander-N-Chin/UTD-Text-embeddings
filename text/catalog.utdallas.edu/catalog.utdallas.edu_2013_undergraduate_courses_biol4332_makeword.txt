RNA Structure and Catalysis (Print Version)









UT Dallas 2013 Undergraduate CatalogBIOL4332 - RNA Structure and CatalysisBIOL 4332 RNA Structure and Catalysis (3 semester hours) A survey of the determinants of RNA secondary and tertiary structure and their role in RNA processing and catalysis. The mechanisms of posttranscriptional RNA processing including base modifications, mRNA capping and poly A addition, 5' and 3' end maturation, intron excision, and RNA editing will be covered as well as the mechanisms of RNA catalysis. The mechanisms of large ribozymes such as Group I and Group II introns and RNAase of P RNA will be contrasted to the mechanisms of small ribozymes such as hairpins and hammerheads. Prerequisites: (BIOL 3301 and BIOL 3302) and (BIOL 3361 or CHEM 3361) or their equivalents, or instructor consent required. (3-0) T
