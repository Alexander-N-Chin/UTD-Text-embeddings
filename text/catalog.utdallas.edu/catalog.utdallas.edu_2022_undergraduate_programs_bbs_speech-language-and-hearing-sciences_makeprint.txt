UT Dallas 2022 Undergraduate Catalog
School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences
Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences (BS)
The Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences program offers study in the processes and disorders of speech, language, and hearing. The program provides the foundation for graduate study leading to career opportunities and clinical certification as a speech-language pathologist or audiologist. Students are advised that admission to graduate programs in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences are presently highly competitive. Only students with strong academic records should select this major.
The curriculum in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences focuses on the development of communicative abilities; the anatomical and physiological mechanisms underlying speech, language, and hearing; the causes of communication disorders in children and adults; and theories and techniques of assessment and treatment of communication disorders.
Students majoring in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences are strongly encouraged to select electives in Psychology to complement coursework in their major field. Suggested electives in the major include SPAU 3305 Language and Literacy Development, SPAU 3342 or PSY 3342 Exceptional Children, SPAU 4342 Assessment Procedures in Speech-Language Pathology, SPAU 4386 Adult Development and Aging, and SPAU 4395 Issues in the Management of Persons with Hearing Impairment.
Students who plan to attend graduate school in speech-language pathology or audiology should be aware that clinical certification by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association requires that students complete at least one course in each of the following subject areas: Biological Sciences (e.g. biology, neuroscience), Physical Sciences (chemistry or physics is strongly recommended), Behavioral Sciences (e.g. psychology, sociology), and (statistics). Completion of this coursework prior to applying to graduate school is strongly advised.
Students who wish to combine Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences with Psychology, Neuroscience, or Child Learning and Development should be able to meet requirements in both majors, and, with the approval of the Associate Dean, complete a double major. Students considering a double major should consult with their advisor regarding specific requirements. Students can complete Core Curriculum and Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences major requirements in a minimum of 78 semester credit hours, leaving 42 elective semester credit hours.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees
UT Dallas undergraduate students with strong academic records who intend to pursue a master's degree in Communication Disorders at the university may consider an accelerated undergraduate-graduate plan of study. If accepted into the program, students may take up to 15 semester credit hours of graduate courses that may be used to complete the baccalaureate degree and also to satisfy requirements for the master's degree. Students must maintain a 3.000 grade point average and earn grades of B or better in graduate courses taken.
Students should apply for Fast Track admission in the semester they reach 90 semester credit hours. To qualify for application, undergraduate students must have completed at least 18 semester credit hours in major core courses at UT Dallas. To be eligible for Fast Track admission, students must have completed at least 90 semester credit hours toward a baccalaureate degree, completed at least 36 hours of the general education core curriculum, and meet program admission requirements, including submission of GRE scores. Apply to the Fast Track program through the graduate Communication Disorders program, not through Enrollment Services.

Admission into the COMD Fast Track program is extremely competitive and highly selective and specific GRE and GPA thresholds must be met.
 
Minor in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences: 18 semester credit hours
Students interested in communication sciences and disorders may elect to minor in Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences. Students complete 18 semester credit hours including 12 required semester credit hours of foundation coursework and 6 elective semester credit hours. Students who take a minor will be expected to meet the normal prerequisites in courses making up the minor, and should maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 on a 4.00 scale (C average). No semester credit hours may be used to satisfy both major and minor requirements; however, free elective semester credit hours or major preparatory classes may be used to satisfy the minor.
