UT Dallas 2013 Undergraduate Catalog
School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics
Chemistry (BA, BS)
The Chemistry major builds on a base of chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computer science to provide the student the opportunity to develop essential theoretical and practical skills in the subdisciplines of organic, physical, inorganic, analytical, and macromolecular chemistry. Typically, the practice of chemistry in industry deals with the synthesis, analysis, and control of the many materials used in our technological society.
The Chemistry program at UT Dallas is designed to instruct the student in how chemical experiments are performed, how results are interpreted, and through its integrated laboratory sequence, to emphasize the importance of one subdisciplines in solving problems inherent to another. Meeting these goals, the Chemistry program provides the student with the flexibility to enter industry, go on to graduate school, or pursue medical, dental, and other degrees in the health sciences.

Degrees
The Chemistry major may choose a program leading either to the BA or BS degree. The latter degree sequence has been approved by the American Chemical Society's Committee on Professional Training.
BA Program
The BA program offers the minimum fundamental knowledge required for adequate professional function in a career in chemistry. It is possible that students choosing this option may, through suitable use of unspecified hours, prepare for careers in areas as varied as chemistry-related businesses, government, medicine and dentistry, secondary school teaching, and even law or politics.
BS Program
The BS program provides more intensive training in chemistry for the student who intends either to obtain employment at the bachelor's level in the chemical industry or to pursue graduate study.
UTeach Option
The UTeach option may be added to the BA degree in Chemistry. UTeach Dallas Option degree plans are streamlined to allow students to complete both a rigorous Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree and all coursework for middle or high school teacher certification in four years. Teaching Option degrees require deep content knowledge combined with courses grounded in the latest research on math and science education. While most graduates go on to classroom teaching, UTeach alums are also prepared to enter graduate school and to work in discipline related industry.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees
Undergraduate students at UT Dallas with strong academic records who intend to pursue the MS in Chemistry at UT Dallas may apply for a Fast Track plan of study which involves taking selected graduate courses as an upper-level student. After admission to the graduate program, 15 hours of graduate courses with an earned grade of B or better can be used toward completion of the baccalaureate degree and to satisfy requirements for the master's degree. Interested students should contact the undergraduate advisor well in advance of the junior year to prepare a sequence permitting maximal advantage to be taken of the catalog's regulations (see catalog.utdallas.edu/2013/undergraduate/policies/graduate-courses) regarding Undergraduate Registration for Graduate Courses.
1. Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from accredited institutions of higher education. The courses listed in parentheses are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
2. A required Major course that also fulfills Core Curriculum requirements. If hours are counted in the Core Curriculum, students must complete additional coursework to meet the minimum requirement for graduation. Course selection assistance is available from the undergraduate advisor.
3. Hours above the Core Curriculum requirement are counted as part of the Major Preparatory Courses.
4. Indicates a prerequisite class to be completed before enrolling for upper-division classes.
5. Research in Chemistry (CHEM 4V91), Research and Advanced Writing in Chemistry (CHEM 4390), and Research and Advanced Writing in Chemistry for Honors Students (CHEM 4399) are better defined as a project than a course and constitute an important part of the BS degree. The student conducts original research under the supervision of a faculty member, and then must submit a research report which is defended orally. Normally this project will span two or more semesters. A complete set of guidelines is available from the undergraduate advisor.
6. NATS 4390 fulfills Core Communication requirement.
