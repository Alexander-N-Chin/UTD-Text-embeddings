‘Chief Zach,’ Police Leader, Pillar of UTD Community, Retires

Larry Zacharias joined UT Dallas as chief of its police department in 2009 and left his stamp on a force that has grown to more than 70 law enforcement and civilian professionals since his arrival. He retired Jan. 31.
Larry Zacharias, who led the rebuilding and growth of The University of Texas at Dallas Police Department, signed off Jan. 31 as UTD’s chief of police after more than 13 years of service.
“This job has been more personally fulfilling than I ever expected it to be,” he said.
Known as “Chief Zach” by most on campus, Zacharias was hired with a charge to clean up a department that was isolated and under investigation.
“He inherited what could charitably be called a broken department,” said Rafael Martín PhD’20, vice president and chief of staff. “He immediately set out to right that ship, and he put into place a culture of community policing and professionalism that endures today.”
Zacharias said the key to rebuilding trust in the department was developing partnerships and relationships across campus.


Larry Zacharias was named Police Chief of the Year by UT System Police twice during his UT Dallas career.

Dr. Amanda Smith, associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students, witnessed the police department’s transition. She said the changes made by Zacharias were quick and very successful.
“He really got his officers out there to mingle with students, faculty and staff. Their presence was more of a protective and helpful presence than a ‘we’re-out-to-get-you’ presence,” she said.
In addition to successfully integrating the police organization with the overall UTD community, Zacharias has grown the department from just a handful of staff working 12-hour shifts to more than 70 law enforcement and civilian professionals.
He also was instrumental in the creation of the University Emergency Medical Response team, a group of student emergency medical technicians that received two national awards last year recognizing its contributions to campus safety.
In addition, Zacharias has twice been named Police Chief of the Year by the UT System Police.
“He wanted to be successful on the UTD campus,” said Michael J. Heidingsfield, director of police for the UT System. “If you look at the growth of UT Dallas, it’s extraordinary what he’s done.”
“Whoever leads the department next will inherit an organization that will bear Chief Zach’s stamp for many, many years to come. I think that’s a great thing for us as an institution.”
Rafael Martín PhD’20, vice president and chief of staff
Zacharias, who served the city of Richardson Police Department for 32 years — seven as chief — before coming to UT Dallas, is a mainstay at commencement ceremonies, Family Day and other special events on campus. Students know him from his campus safety talks at every student orientation.
He also has become one of the biggest fans of Comet Sports and made it a point to get to know both student-athletes and their parents. Zacharias has even hosted annual barbecue dinners at his home for UTD’s basketball and volleyball teams and has been known to attend out-of-town games. Several teams have presented him with championship rings with his name on them whenever they bring home a trophy.
Zacharias said his most difficult time as chief was during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the campus was closed.
“It wasn’t fun: not seeing the students, not going to student activities, not going to athletic events. I didn’t even get out on campus on my golf cart,” he said. “Those are the things that have made my job fun.”
After he retires, Zacharias and his wife plan on traveling more — spending time with family and relaxing in the mountains of New Mexico. He also plans on getting his “golf game back in order.” He said he likely will continue to attend some Comet athletic events.
Martín said a new police chief would likely be named in February. He said that person will take over a professional, community-focused organization that is an integral part of the campus.
“Whoever leads the department next will inherit an organization that will bear Chief Zach’s stamp for many, many years to come,” he said. “I think that’s a great thing for us as an institution.”
