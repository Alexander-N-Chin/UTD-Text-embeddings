NOTE> Please be advised, the admissions section below feeds in from a separate page. Any changes made to the admissions section below will not be retained. Please contact catalog@utdallas.edu with any questions.
Admission Requirements
The University's general admission requirements are discussed on the Graduate Admission page.
A student lacking undergraduate prerequisites for graduate courses in electrical engineering must complete these prerequisites or receive approval from the graduate advisor and the course instructor.
A diagnostic exam may be required. Specific admission requirements follow.
The student entering the MSEE program should meet the following guidelines:

An undergraduate preparation equivalent to a baccalaureate in electrical engineering from an accredited engineering program.
A grade point average in upper-division quantitative coursework of 3.0 or better on a 4.0 point scale, and
GRE revised scores of 154, 156, and 4 for the verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing components, respectively, are advisable based on our experience with student success in the program.

Applicants must submit three letters of recommendation from individuals who are able to judge the candidate's probability of success in pursuing a program of study leading to the master's degree. Applicants must also submit an essay outlining the candidate's background, education, and professional goals.
Students from other engineering disciplines or from other science and math areas may be considered for admission to the program; however, some additional coursework may be necessary before starting the master's program.

Degree Requirements
The University's general degree requirements are discussed on the Graduate Policies and Procedures page.
The MSEE requires a minimum of 30 semester credit hours.
All students must have an academic advisor and an approved degree plan. These are based upon the student's choice of concentration (Circuits; Computing Systems; Devices; Power Electronics and Energy; Signals and Systems). Courses taken without advisor approval will not count toward the 30 semester credit hour requirement. Successful completion of the approved course of studies leads to the MSEE degree.
The MSEE program has both a thesis and a non-thesis option. All part-time MSEE students will be assigned initially to the non-thesis option. Those wishing to elect the thesis option may do so by obtaining the approval of a faculty thesis supervisor. With the prior approval of an academic advisor, non-thesis students may count no more than 3 semester credit hours of research or individual instruction courses towards the 30 semester credit hour degree requirement.
All full-time, supported students are required to participate in the thesis option. The thesis option requires twelve semester credit hours of research (of which at least three must be thesis semester credit hours), a written thesis submitted to the graduate school, and a formal public defense of the thesis. The supervising committee administers this defense and is chosen in consultation with the student's thesis advisor prior to enrolling for thesis credit. Research and thesis semester credit hours cannot be counted in an MSEE degree plan unless a thesis is written and successfully defended.
Concentrations
One of the five concentrations listed below, subject to approval by a graduate advisor, must be used to fulfill the requirements of the MSEE program. Each concentration is defined by three core courses. A student must complete remaining courses from department and school wide electives. Students must achieve an overall GPA (grade point average) of 3.0 or better, a GPA of 3.0 or better in their core MSEE classes, and a grade of B- or better in all their core MSEE classes in order to satisfy their degree requirements. One 5000 level electrical engineering course can be counted towards the graduate semester credit hours.

Admission Requirements
The University's general admission requirements are discussed on the Graduate Admission page.
The PhD in Electrical Engineering is awarded primarily to acknowledge the student's success in an original research project, the description of which is a significant contribution to the literature of the discipline. Applicants for the doctoral program are therefore selected by the Electrical Engineering Program Graduate Committee on the basis of research aptitude, as well as academic record. Applications for the doctoral program are considered on an individual basis.
The following are guidelines for admission to the PhD program in Electrical Engineering:

A master's degree in electrical engineering or a closely associated discipline from an institution of higher education in the U.S. or from an acceptable foreign university. Consideration will be given to highly qualified students wishing to pursue the doctorate without satisfying all of the requirements for a master's degree. A grade point average (GPA) in graduate coursework of 3.5 or better on a 4.0 point scale
GRE revised scores of 154, 156, and 4 for the verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing components, respectively, are advisable based on our experience with student success in the program.

Applicants must submit three letters of recommendation on official school or business letterhead or the UT Dallas Letter of Recommendation Form from individuals who are familiar with the student's record and able to judge the candidate's probability of success in pursuing doctoral study in electrical engineering.
Applicants must also submit a narrative describing their motivation for doctoral study and how it relates to their professional goals.
For students who are interested in a PhD but are unable to attend school full-time, there is a part-time option. The guidelines for admission to the program and the degree requirements are the same as for full- time PhD students. All students must have an academic advisor and an approved plan of study.

Degree Requirements
The University's general degree requirements are discussed on the Graduate Policies and Procedures page.
Each program for doctoral study is individually tailored to the student's background and research objectives by the student's supervisory committee. The program will require a minimum of 75 semester credit hours beyond the baccalaureate degree. These credits must include at least 30 semester credit hours of graduate level courses beyond the baccalaureate level in the major concentration. All PhD students must demonstrate competence in the master's level core courses in their research area. All students must have an academic advisor and an approved plan of study.
Also required are:

A qualifying examination (QE), as approved by the EE graduate committee, demonstrating competence in the PhD candidate's research area. A student entering the PhD program with a MS degree must pass this exam within three (3) long semesters, and a student entering without a MS degree must pass this exam within four (4) long semesters. A student has, at most, two attempts at this qualifying exam. The exam will be given during the fall and spring semesters. Details of the QE policy can be found on the ECE department website.
A comprehensive exam consists of a written dissertation proposal, a public seminar, and a private oral examination conducted by the PhD candidate's supervising committee.
