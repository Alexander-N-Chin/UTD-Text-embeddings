Academic Probation is designed to help students make the required adjustments to achieve success and a degree at UT Dallas. These adjustments will vary based upon the individual circumstances of each student, but should be taken seriously.
If a student is placed on Academic Probation, the student will be required to follow certain protocols and meet higher academic standards. These protocols and standards are designed to bring the student back to Academic Good Standing and allow the student to meet graduation requirements.
A student on Academic Probation is required to meet the following Academic Probation Requirements for the semester:

May not withdraw or request an incomplete from a class.

If a student on Academic Probation meets the Academic Probation Requirements but fails to achieve a cumulative GPA of 2.000, the student will remain on Academic Probation and must continue to comply with all Academic Probation Requirements.Â 
If at any time, a student's cumulative GPA meets the minimum requirements of 2.000 overall the student will regain Academic Good Standing. A student's cumulative GPA is only affected by UT Dallas coursework. Coursework at another institution cannot be used to return a student to Academic Good Standing.

If a student is placed on Academic Warning, the student should consider dramatic alterations in all of the circumstances that affect his or her academic progress. The student should increase the volume of work with the SOAR advisor and meet with his or her Faculty Mentors or Associate Dean to determine an academic path to success.

If a student has been placed on Academic Suspension and wishes to select a different academic discipline, the student must first complete the "Undergraduate Change of Major Form" prior to petitioning for readmission. If the Change of Major is approved, the student must petition to the new Associate Dean for readmission.
