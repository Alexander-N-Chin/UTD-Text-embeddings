XXVII Texas Symposium
UTD Physics







Our group is concerned with problems in cosmology, astrophysics and general relativity. 
These involve analytical, numerical, and data-related projects. Our group has recently expanded significantly 
its areas of research and has research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students (for more information, 
contact the group leader, Prof. Mustapha Ishak, at mishak@utdallas.edu, or other faculty in the group).  
Our group is funded by NASA, DOE, NSF, private foundations and the corporate sector. 

The group is instrumental in organizing the biennial Texas Symposia on Relativistic Astrophysics, 
beginning in Dallas in 1963 and recurring regularly all over the world since then. We hosted the 50th anniversary Texas Symposium in 2013.
