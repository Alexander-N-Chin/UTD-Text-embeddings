Undergraduate Policies and Procedures
International Education
Information about international educational opportunities is available at the Office of International Education (OIE), Green Center (GC) 2.216. Students are required to satisfy the institutional protocol for international mobility under the guidance of OIE advisors to select the program most appropriate to their individual needs and interests. The advising process includes University policies governing international education, application, selection procedures, funding sources, international health insurance, emergency procedures, and liability issues, among other aspects. Information is also disseminated through study abroad fairs, special events, group meetings, individual appointments, reference materials and at the OIE website.
Students may participate in international educational programs through five types of mobility:

Study Abroad: Students register for study abroad courses after they complete the institutional protocol, which includes the approval of the Associate Dean of the appropriate academic department, the approval of the Office of the Registrar, and the endorsement of OIE. Study Abroad programs are offered by organizations and institutions specialized in designing academic courses in foreign destinations for U.S. students. Credits are awarded as transfer credits. Students are responsible for paying program fees directly to the selected study abroad provider. Therefore, students are not assessed UT Dallas' tuition and fees. Student may not apply their Academic Excellence Scholarships toward these programs.
Exchange Program: Students register full time at UT Dallas, but pursue the academic program in a foreign university with which UT Dallas has an active Exchange Program Agreement. Students may select from a large portfolio of exchange programs with the academic guidance of the Associate Dean from the appropriate academic department, who assesses the academic content of the program for UT Dallas credit equivalency purposes. Students earn resident credit. Students are assessed the normal UT Dallas' tuition and fees. Students may apply their Academic Excellence Scholarships toward these programs.
Independent Studies: For independent studies, students register academic work designed to be pursued in a foreign destination under UT Dallas' faculty supervision and with the approval of the appropriate department. Students are assessed normal tuition and fees for the number of semester credit hours they undertake as independent studies.
Internships: For internships, students register a work assignment related directly to their field of study in a foreign destination under UT Dallas' faculty supervision. Students are assessed normal tuition and fees for the number of semester credit hours they undertake as an internship. Students should visit the internship coordinator in the Career Center to go over departmental guidelines.
Faculty-led Programs: Academic units may offer courses taught abroad as part of their regular curriculum. Students who take these courses follow normal registration procedures and are assessed normal tuition and fees for the number of semester credit hours they undertake. Additional fees are charged to cover program costs.

A student must have a minimum of 2.000 GPA to participate in study abroad programs, independent studies, or internships. A student must have a minimum of 3.000 GPA to participate in exchange programs. GPA requirements for faculty-led programs are determined by the academic unit offering the program.

Grades/Credits
Credits earned in study abroad programs, exchange programs, independent studies, internships, and/or faculty-led programs translate directly onto UT Dallas' transcript.
Core Curriculum courses taken while studying abroad must be taken for a grade. A minimum of 2.000 on a scale of 4.000 must be earned to transfer credits to UT Dallas.
The Office of the Registrar will review transcripts and assign credit(s).
Official Transcripts
Transcripts must be mailed to the Office of International Education. Transcripts received from foreign institutions in a language other than English must be translated by a professional translation service for official posting of transfer credit. The use of a professional translation service ensures the authenticity, consistency, and accuracy of transferring credits. It is the responsibility of the student to provide an English translation of the transcript and pay any associated costs. Transcript translation services are not provided by the University.
Programs
The Associate Deans in each school determine how general courses and Core Curriculum courses apply to UT Dallas' degree plan. Approval may be required by more than one Associate Dean for courses outside the student's major. All courses must be pre-approved by the Associate Dean from the appropriate academic department, the Office of the Registrar, and the Office of International Education.
Travel Warnings
The University of Texas at Dallas does not recommend nor support study abroad programs in regions of the world for which the U.S. State Department has issued a "Travel Warning." Students considering study in regions with Travel Warnings must submit their cases to the Secretary of the UT Dallas Advisory Council on International Education (ACIE), OIE Director, for further evaluation (www.utdallas.edu/oie/acie.htm). A Travel Warning is the federal government's recommendation to avoid or consider the risk of travel to a specific foreign destination.
