UT Dallas 2013 Undergraduate CatalogBIOL4310 - Cellular MicrobiologyBIOL 4310 Cellular Microbiology (3 semester hours) The course covers topics related to pathogenesis of infectious diseases in the context of host cell properties. It introduces various human pathogens and describes their virulence, and explores the evolutionary aspects of how pathogens interact with their host cells and how host cells defend themselves against invading microorganisms. Topics include bacterial toxins and secretion mechanisms, virus infections, microbial invasion and intracellular parasitism, manipulation of host cell functions and induction of cell death by pathogens, innate and acquired defense mechanisms of the host, inflammation, sepsis, and advances of microbial genomics involving human microbiome, vaccines, and anti-infectives. The course aims to complement the scientific knowledge and principles established in cell biology, medical microbiology and immunology with appropriate relevance to clinical applications involving parasitology and infectious disease control.
