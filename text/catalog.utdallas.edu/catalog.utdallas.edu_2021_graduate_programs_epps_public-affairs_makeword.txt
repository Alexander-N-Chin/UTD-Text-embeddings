Mission
The mission of the PhD in Public Affairs program is to prepare students for research-oriented careers in academia, policy analysis, and executive public/nonprofit management positions. The rigorous core curriculum provides advanced conceptual and theoretical training in the principal areas of public administration and management, including: human resource management, nonprofit management, public policy, government finance, leadership, and organizational theory.
Objectives
Through a faculty-guided program of instruction, research and mentoring, students in the Public Affairs doctoral program develop a firm understanding of the broad intellectual tradition of public administration and related fields. The guiding philosophy of the degree is that "public affairs" involves more than a merely functional administration, policy implementation or quantitative policy analysis. Rather, doctoral education in public affairs requires an interface between the traditions of public management, public policy, and organizational theory with a practical appreciation for the challenges of maintaining and building institutions of governance and a civic culture in a complex democratic society.
The PhD in Public Affairs begins as a cohort program where entering students remain together through the completion of the core curriculum and a qualifying examination (QE). This structure produces shared experiences that enrich student learning and research.
Faculty Commitments
The faculty of the PhD program in Public Affairs are committed to assist students in meeting a set of clear and specific education- and research-related goals. The specific objectives for all graduates of the PhD in Public Affairs program are to:
Demonstrate Comprehensive Knowledge. Students will demonstrate their knowledge in core areas of public administration and management, including: theoretical foundations of public administration, public policy, organization theory, budgeting and governmental finance, and human capital.
Understand and Apply Theories and Processes of Knowledge Acquisition. Students will demonstrate familiarity with key theories in each of the principal fields of public administration and management, and will apply this theoretical knowledge in the development of research projects ranging from course assignments to their dissertation research projects.
Produce Scholarly Manuscripts and Publications. Students, as scholars, will have the ability to conduct research projects that use state-of-the-art methodologies to produce scholarly manuscripts that are worthy of publication in the journals of the field.
Develop, Present, and Defend Complex Ideas. Students will have the ability to develop, present, and defend, both orally and in writing, complex ideas based on in-depth scholarly research.
Facilities
PhD students have access to the computing facilities in the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences and the University's computer labs. The school has four computing laboratories that are equipped with major social science software packages including ArcGIS, R, SPSS, and Stata.
Application, Admission and Assistantships
Application Deadlines: Due to the cohort nature of the PhD program in Public Affairs, admissions are limited to the fall semester only. The application deadline for students seeking funding through assistantships is January 15. The application deadline for students not seeking funding is May 1. The following link provides details for application fees and deadlines: graduate-admissions.utdallas.edu/steps-to-admission/fees-and-deadlines
NOTE> Please be advised, the admissions section below feeds in from a separate page. Any changes made to the admissions section below will not be retained. Please contact catalog@utdallas.edu with any questions.
Admission Requirements
The University's general admission requirements are discussed on the Graduate Admission page.
Admission Requirements: The program only admits students who have completed a master's degree from an institution of higher education. It is preferred that the master's degree is in public affairs or another social science field. A graduate GPA (grade point average) of 3.0 or better is expected. Prospective students must complete the University's online graduate application and submit a narrative outlining 1) academic interests, 2) current or long-range interests in research, teaching, or other professional objectives, 3) a description of publications or other scholarly endeavors, and 4) a listing of academic and professional organizations and fellowships, scholarships, or other honors received. The Graduation Record Examination (GRE) scores are required.
International students whose native language is not English are also required to submit the Test of English as a Second Language (TOEFL) with a minimum score of 80, unless they graduated from a four-year college or university in the United States or other English speaking country. Students should submit examination scores and transcripts from all colleges previously attended to UT Dallas' Office of Admission and Enrollment Services.
A Curriculum Vitae (CV) and three letters of recommendation from individuals (faculty, employers, community leaders, teachers, etc.) who are able to judge a student's probable success in graduate school are required. The CV and the letters should be uploaded online. Applicants are also encouraged to include a writing sample as part of their application.
International applicants without Permanent Resident Visas must submit evidence of financial support (financial affidavit and original bank statement) before they can receive the I-20 or other required documents needed for a visa application.

Teaching Assistantships: Prospective students interested in receiving assistantships must have submitted all admission application materials including a Teaching Assistant (TA) application form by January 15 of the year they intend to start the program. Applications for the assistantships may be obtained from the Public & Nonprofit Management Program Office. Offers of teaching assistantships will be made during the spring semester prior to fall enrollment, although additional appointments may be made as new positions become available each semester.
It is expected that those applying for a TA position can communicate effectively in both written and spoken English. State law and regulations of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board require that international students appointed as TA's be proficient in the use of the English language. An English Proficiency Interview conducted under the auspices of the office of the Dean of Graduate Education will be used to screen for students requiring remedial help in the form of English as a Second Language (ESL) course. International students must satisfy the proficiency requirement upon appointment or pass the ESL course within two semesters to be eligible for consideration of continued appointment as a TA.
Program Overview
The PhD in Public Affairs requires the completion of at least 54 semester credit hours of coursework beyond a 36-semester credit hour Master's degree. The 54 credit hours should include a minimum of 45 semester credit hours of coursework, and a minimum of 9 semester credit hours of dissertation work.
Students who do not meet the 36 semester credit hours of Master's degree requirement will be required to take additional courses as directed by the PhD advisor. Funded students will be required to take at least 9 semester credit hours per semester in order to retain funding.
Prerequisites
Prior to enrolling in core classes for the PhD program, students must have completed a master's degree in public affairs/administration or another field. In addition, students should have completed a graduate-level course in quantitative methods and a course on public institutions in the recent past. Students who do not meet either of these prerequisites should contact the PhD advisor to discuss leveling courses they will need to take prior to beginning the PhD program. The leveling courses will not count toward the degree plan.
Qualifying Exam (QE)
Students must pass the QE to continue in the PhD program. This exam is based on materials from the following four courses: (1) PA 7306 Foundations of Public Affairs, (2) PA 7330 Research Design in Public Affairs, (3) PA 7314 Advanced Policy Process, Implementation and Evaluation, and (4) PA 7350 Advanced Organizational Theory and Behavior. The exam will be administered once a year, near the close of the spring semester.
Students must have a grade of B or better in each of the four exam-related courses to be eligible to sit for the exam. Students who do not meet this requirement may choose to leave the program or repeat a course to earn a better grade (only one course may be repeated). Students are encouraged to review the University's Retaking Courses Policy. Students retaking an exam related course are required to enroll in the course in the next semester it is offered. Students will not be permitted to enroll in courses outside the doctoral core curriculum until successful completion of the QE.
If a student fails any section of the exam, he or she will be given the opportunity to retake failed section(s). The retake exam can be taken no sooner than two months after the student receives the written results of the first examination, and no later than one year after the first examination. If the student passes the retake exam he or she may continue in the program. If the student fails any part of the retake exam or does not successfully complete the retake exam he or she will be dismissed from the program. Under no circumstances will a third examination be allowed.
Only under extreme, documented circumstances will a student be allowed to reschedule the QE. If an emergency arises, the student must notify the program head within 12 semester credit hours of the scheduled exam and request to take a rescheduled exam. If approved, the exam will be rescheduled within 2 weeks of the original exam date.

Graduate Certificate in Local Government Management
12 semester credit hours
The School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences offers a Graduate Certificate in Local Government Management for local government professionals and for MPA students who desire to broaden their knowledge of important issues and approaches employed by professional local public administrators. Local governments in the United States play an important role in our democratic system. They are the place in our democratic system where citizens have the most direct contact with elected and appointed officials on numerous issues.
Local government managers operate in a complex legal and political environment. They are responsible for the provision of varied services directly to citizens, such as land use planning, law enforcement, water and sewer services, and recreation. Both the method and quality of service delivery are greatly influenced by managers who are hired by elected officials. The management of cities and counties has become increasingly professional over the past several decades. How the professional staff delivers services to the public within the political environment in which it works is the topic of many of the courses in this program. Students will gain knowledge and skills that will allow them to lead and manage in local government settings; learn critical thinking and strategic thinking; and learn to communicate in a strategic manner.
Requirements for admission to the certificate program are the same as for a non-degree seeking graduate student. Completion of twelve (12) semester credit hours is required to attain the Graduate Certificate in Local Government Management and those semester credit hours may count toward a degree if the student completes all requirements for full admission as a graduate student. The face-to-face program will continue to be offered at the UT Dallas campus. Majority of the classes will be taught in the city hall facilities in the City of Plano, specifically at its Municipal Center, or at an alternate site in one of the other participating city which has been agreed to by the cities and UT Dallas for the off-campus program.

Nonprofit organizations constitute an increasingly significant sector of the American economy as well as an essential element in American civic life. Nonprofits are found in such diverse fields as health care, education, human services, and criminal justice, as well as in cultural and civic activities. Faced with resource constraints and rising demands for accountability, nonprofit organizations require professional managers with an understanding of both administrative principles and techniques and of the distinctive legal, economic, and social environment within which nonprofits operate.
The Certificate in Nonprofit Management is designed to provide an overview of the nature and context of nonprofit organizations combined with skill-based courses to develop the competencies needed by nonprofit managers. The certificate is intended for professionals already working in the nonprofit sector, those working in private for-profit or governmental settings who would like to work or volunteer in the nonprofit sector, and students without professional experience who seek to prepare themselves for nonprofit careers.
Completion of twelve (12) semester credit hours are required to attain the Certificate in Nonprofit Management and those semester credit hours may be counted toward a degree if the student completes all requirements for full admission as a graduate student.
