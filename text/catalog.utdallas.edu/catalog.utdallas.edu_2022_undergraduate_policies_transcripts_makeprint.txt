Academic Record
A major is defined as an academic discipline or a field of study in a specific subject area, such as mathematics. There will be a set of required and elective courses that need to be taken as part of the major.  Other courses include core curriculum courses and freshman and sophomore prerequisites.
Three levels of degrees exist: (1) the undergraduate level (the baccalaureate or a bachelor's), (2) the master's level, and (3) the doctoral level.  Each degree has a designation such as Arts, Science, or Philosophy, for example, a Bachelor's of Arts (BA), a Master of Science (MS) or a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).
A degree program comprises of all the above elements.  In other words, a student will enroll in a major on the undergraduate level in order to earn a degree, such as, a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics.

The Office of the Registrar retains a listing of approved items recorded on the official transcript. 
Texas state law requires public institutions to include the following notations on the undergraduate official transcript Texas Success Initiative status, Core Curriculum Completion notation, Disciplinary Action notation, and Six Drop notation. 
The official academic transcript will list the degree and major, and if applicable, second major or double degree, minors, concentrations, designations, academic certificates, and academic honors. Only concentrations whose requirements are published in the catalog will be identified on the transcript. Majors with concentrations are designated on the official transcript when the degree is awarded. Minors, concentrations, designations, and academic certificates are not printed on the diploma in accordance with University policy.
