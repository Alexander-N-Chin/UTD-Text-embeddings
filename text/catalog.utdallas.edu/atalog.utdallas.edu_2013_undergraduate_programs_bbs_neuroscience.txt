UT Dallas 2013 Undergraduate Catalog
School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences
Neuroscience (BS)
Neuroscience is the multidisciplinary study of brain function that draws on recent advances in cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, biophysics, and computer and behavioral and cognitive sciences. It examines the brain's global and nanoscale biochemistry, its complex and extensively networked anatomical structure, and its remarkably adaptive physiology. The field considers neuronal development from early embryology through advanced senescence, and examines the brain's plasticity from the level of single proteins, of individual neurons, up through the level of networks or systems of cells, on up to complete behaving organisms. It studies the regulation and expression of behavior, the impact of that behavior on the brain, and the complex interactions of multiple neuronal systems that underlie the emergence of cognitive function. The Neuroscience program at UT Dallas provides students with the opportunity to focus on the brain from a systems-level perspective, drawing on behavioral and cognitive expertise combined with cellular and molecular analyses. It allows undergraduates extensive interactions with working neuroscientists who use the latest experimental techniques.
The Neuroscience program is designed to prepare students for admission to graduate, medical, or dental school, or for careers in related biomedical research, industry, and allied health science fields. Required courses and guided electives can include the approved pre-medical curriculum and offer an alternative to other traditional pre-health majors. Students who wish to continue their education in the fields of medicine, dentistry or allied professional areas should register with the Health Professions Advising Center during their first semester. Students are encouraged to design a personalized degree plan of guided electives with their advisor that combines courses from the neurosciences and related disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, computer science, psychology, and speech pathology and audiology in a way that will suit their individual interests and goals. Students are also strongly encouraged to gain research experience as part of their undergraduate training in Neuroscience.
Students can complete Core Curriculum and Neuroscience major requirements in a minimum of 85 semester credit hours, leaving 35 elective hours. Students can complete Core Curriculum, Neuroscience major, and pre-health Professions requirements in a minimum of 111 semester credit hours, leaving 9 remaining elective hours.
