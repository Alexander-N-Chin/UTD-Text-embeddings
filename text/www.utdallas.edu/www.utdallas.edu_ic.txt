International Center Statement on Sudan: 
Peace and dialogue are essential to human flourishing. The International Center condemns the fighting in Sudan and we offer our condolences to the Sudanese people for the loss of life, and disturbance of your peace and progression towards democracy. While on the ground humanitarian support may be limited due to the intensity of the conflict, we encourage the university community to provide support to affected communities when feasible. For members of the UT Dallas Sudanese community, we are here to support you and your loved ones during this challenging period as we are able.  Reach out to us or the UT Dallas counseling services if you need help.
We provide access to quality international education that impacts all of UT Dallas by building and cultivating strategic partnerships locally and abroad; supporting the success of international students and scholars; and developing safe and meaningful opportunities for students, faculty and staff to interact with peers and colleagues across the globe.
The UT Dallas International Center is organized administratively into two major offices: International Education and International Students and Scholars.



International Education
Supports the UTD strategic plan of  global engagement by preparing students to lead in this globally interconnected and diverse world through a variety of international education programs; by supporting the health, safety and security of the UTD community traveling abroad; and by facilitating international partnerships.
