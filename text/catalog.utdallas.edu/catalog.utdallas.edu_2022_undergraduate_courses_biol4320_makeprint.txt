UT Dallas 2022 Undergraduate CatalogBIOL4320 - Cell Migration in Health and DiseaseBIOL 4320 Cell Migration in Health and Disease (3 semester credit hours) Cell adhesion and migration play important roles in normal development, immune responses, wound healing and regeneration. Dysregulated migration underlies many conditions including congenital disorders, chronic inflammation, and cancer invasion and metastasis. This course will examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cell adhesion and migration in normal, regenerative and diseased states. Model systems, tools, and technologies used to study and analyze cell migration will be discussed. The course will include didactic lectures, enquiry-based learning and student presentations. Prerequisites: (BIOL 3301 and BIOL 3302) and (BIOL 3361 or CHEM 3361) or equivalent or instructor consent required. (3-0) S
