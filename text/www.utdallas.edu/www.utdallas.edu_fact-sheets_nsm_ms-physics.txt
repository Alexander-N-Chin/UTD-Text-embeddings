Master of Science in Physics




Program Description
Developed by top-tier faculty at The University of Texas at Dallas, the Master of Science in Physics degree program trains students interested in developing a technical mastery of the fundamentals and current applications of physics. The program introduces students to complex ideas and problems and makes it possible for them to participate in ongoing research activities from the beginning of their graduate studies. For students interested in greater specialization, the program offers four unique tracks:

Atmospheric and Space Physics
Astrophysics/Cosmology/Relativity
Condensed Matter Physics/Materials Science
High Energy Physics.

By teaching students advanced skills and providing hands-on experience with cutting-edge research projects, the Physics master’s program trains students to be thoughtful, creative problem-solvers with the technical expertise necessary for career success in academia, government or industry.
Benefits
The Physics master’s program ensures that students gain a broad understanding of the field, apply their knowledge and analytical skills to create effective and novel solutions to practical problems and communicate and work effectively in collaborative environments.
Other benefits include:

World-Class Faculty: The program is led by faculty of the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics who are widely cited experts in their respective fields.
Comprehensive Curriculum: Courses in the Physics master’s program will introduce students to new ideas, technologies, and competencies while preparing them to succeed in competitive, ever-changing industries.
Lab Experience: Lab work will introduce students to fundamental and advanced concepts as well as state-of-the-art research techniques.
Facilities: A cluster of buildings and research labs on the northwest side of campus comprise the over 300,000-square-foot space where students can explore the sciences including the famous Natural Sciences and Research Lab – the “mermaid building” and the Sciences Building. Opened in 2020, the 186,000-square-foot Sciences Building is home to state-of-the-art labs for advanced research in mathematical, biological and physical sciences.
Location: Situated in the greater Dallas region—recently rated by Forbes magazine as the #1 “Best City for Jobs”—UT Dallas provides students with easy access to employers and internship opportunities, not to mention a large and supportive alumni population.

Application Deadlines and Requirements
Please take note of all application deadlines and visit the Apply Now webpage to begin the application process. See the Department of Physics graduate programs website for additional information.
Applicants to the Physics master’s degree program should have:

A bachelor’s degree in Physics or a closely related subject from a university or college plus superior skills in quantitative and deductive analysis. Applicants should have an undergraduate background that includes mechanics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, thermal physics, quantum mechanics, modern physics, and/or atomic physics. Students who lack this foundation may be required to take one or more undergraduate courses to complete their preparation for graduate study.
A grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. Test Scores: A score from the GRE General Test (verbal and quantitative) is required. The GRE Subject Test in Physics is optional. Decisions on admission are made on an individual basis. However, as a guide, a combined score on the verbal and quantitative parts of the GRE General Test of 308, with at least 155 on the quantitative part, is advisable based on experience with student success in the program.
International applicants must submit a TOEFL score of at least 80 on the internet-based test. Scores must be less than two years old. See the Graduate Catalog for additional information regarding English proficiency requirements for international applicants.
