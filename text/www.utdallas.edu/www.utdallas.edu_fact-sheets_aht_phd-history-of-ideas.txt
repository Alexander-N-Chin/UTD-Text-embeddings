Doctor of Philosophy in History of Ideas




Program Description
The PhD in History of Ideas degree program is designed primarily for individuals who wish to conduct advanced research and to teach at the college level, but it is open to qualified candidates who wish to enhance their knowledge and skills.
The program focuses on the study of history and philosophy, and especially the intersection of the two. Though students will choose an emphasis in either history or philosophy, their studies will be made in the context of both.
Besides coursework in history and philosophy, students may take seminars in literature, visual and performing arts and cognate disciplines.
Career Opportunities
Graduates of the program seek positions such as: teacher/educator, researcher, historical site/museum curator, public history administrator, public policy administrator, archivist, writer and manager for public and private historical organizations. Career settings may include higher education, non-profits, cultural and historical organizations, government agencies, international development organizations, museums and archives, business/corporate entities and independent consulting.
