Actuarial Science (BS)
The Bachelor of Science Actuarial Science (AS) Program at The University of Texas at Dallas is administered through the Department of Mathematical Sciences. Students receive rigorous well-rounded actuarial education with a strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, computer and data science, economics, and finance. All students are prepared to take seven actuarial preliminary Society of Actuaries (SOA) exams:  Probability - P/1, Financial Mathematics - FM/2, Fundamentals of  Actuarial Mathematics - FAM, Advanced Short Term Actuarial Mathematics - ASTAM, Advanced Long Term Actuarial Mathematics - ALTAM, Statistics for Risk Modeling - SRM, Predictive Analytics - PA.  Students achieve Validation of Educational Experience (VEE) credits in Accounting and Finance, Economics, and Mathematical Statistics.  Students also receive rigorous instruction in preparation for a major part of the three Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) Exams: Actuarial Models: Financial Economics - 3F, Modern Actuarial Statistics I and II - MAS I and MAS II. Upon completion of this program, students will have the knowledge and business background necessary to pursue a career as actuaries, as well as to undertake graduate study in actuarial science, statistics, mathematics, economics, data science or finance.

Interested students should see the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education (ADU) for specific requirements.
1. Incoming freshmen must enroll and complete requirements of UNIV 1010 and the corresponding school-related freshman seminar course. Students, including transfer students, who complete their core curriculum at UT Dallas must take UNIV 2020.
2. Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses from institutions of higher education. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
3. A required Major preparatory course that also fulfills a Core Curriculum requirement. Semester credit hours are counted in Core Curriculum.
4. Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted to fulfill the Mathematics Core Requirement with the remaining one semester credit hour to be counted under Component Area Option Core Requirement.
5. Students may choose one of the following calculus sequences: (a) MATH 2413, MATH 2414, and MATH 2415; or (b) MATH 2417 and MATH 2419.
6. Six semester credit hours of Physics or Chemistry are counted under Science core, and one semester credit hour of Physics or Chemistry (PHYS 2125 or CHEM 1111) are counted under Component Area Option core.
7. Please consult your advisor if selecting Honors Physics.
8. Students may use three semester credit hours of PHYS 2421 to count under Science core, and one semester credit hour of PHYS 2421 under Component Area Option core.
9. MATH 2370 will provide basic knowledge of a programming and numeric computing platform MATLAB and a better preparation for MATH 4334 Numerical Analysis course if elected.
10. Students who complete PHYS 2421 do not need to complete PHYS 2125.
