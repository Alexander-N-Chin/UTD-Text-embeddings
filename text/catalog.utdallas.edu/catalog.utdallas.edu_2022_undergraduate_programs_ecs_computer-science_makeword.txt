UT Dallas 2022 Undergraduate Catalog
Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science
Department of Computer Science
Computer Science (BS)
The Computer Science Department offers the BS degree in Computer Science and the BS degree in Software Engineering. Both are based on a solid foundation of mathematics, including calculus, and discrete mathematics. These programs of study are designed to offer students opportunities to prepare for an industrial, business, or governmental career in a rapidly changing profession and to prepare for graduate study in a field in which further education is strongly recommended. The two programs have the same basis in core computer science, including the analysis of algorithms and data structures, modern programming methodologies, and the study of operating systems. The Computer Science program continues with courses in advanced data structures, programming languages, telecommunications networks, and automata theory, while the Software Engineering program includes courses in requirements engineering, software validation and testing, and software architecture, culminating in a challenging project course in which students must demonstrate use of software engineering techniques. Both programs offer a rich choice of elective studies, including courses in artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and compiler design.
The school offers a "fast track" BS / MS option; see Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degree Program.
The Computer Science Department and the Department of Mathematical Sciences in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics jointly offer a BS degree in Data Science.
Mission of the Department of Computer Science
The mission of the Department of Computer Science is to prepare undergraduate and graduate students for productive careers in industry, academia, and government by providing an outstanding environment for teaching, learning, and research in the theory and applications of computing. The Department places a high priority on establishing and maintaining innovative research programs to enhance its education quality and make it an important regional, national, and international resource center for discovering, integrating, and applying new knowledge and technologies.
Goals for the Computer Science Program
The undergraduate Computer Science program is committed to providing students with a high-quality education and preparing them for long and successful careers in industry and government.
Our graduates, while eminently ready for immediate employment, will also be fully ready for focused training as required for specific positions in Computer Science and closely related areas. Graduates interested in highly technical careers, research, and/or academia will be fully prepared to further their education in graduate school.
Program Educational Objectives for Computer Science
Within a few years after graduation, graduates of the Computer Science program should:

Have a successful, long-lived, computer science based career path.
Meet the needs of industry or academia.
Contribute to, and/or lead, computer science based teams.
Actively pursue continuing (lifelong) learning.

ABET Accreditation
The BS program in Computer Science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.

III. Elective Requirements: 10 semester credit hours
Free Electives: 10 semester credit hours
Both lower- and upper-division courses may count as free electives but students must complete at least 51 semester credit hours of upper-division courses to qualify for graduation.
Degree programs in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science are governed by various accreditation boards that place restrictions on classes used to meet the curricular requirements of degrees they certify. For this reason, not all classes offered by the University can be used to meet elective requirements. Please check with your academic advisor before enrolling in classes you hope to use as free electives.

Fast Track Baccalaureate/Master's Degrees
In response to the need for post-baccalaureate education in the exciting field of computer science, a Fast Track program is available to well-qualified UT Dallas undergraduate students. Qualified seniors may take up to 15 graduate semester credit hours that may be used to complete the baccalaureate degree and also to satisfy requirements for the master's degree. Interested students should see the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education (ADU) for specific requirements.
Honors Programs
The Department of Computer Science offers an Honors Program called Computer Science Computing Scholars (CS2). (CS2) is an intense Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Degree Program created for exceptionally gifted students who wish to pursue a demanding course of study enriched throughout with research experiences. The Computing Scholars Program has a specially designed curriculum. Courses integrate discussion of current research, recent discoveries, and open problems into a rich logical progression of firmly related topics. Course numbers for the Core Curriculum Requirements and Major Requirements are the same as those for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, but Computing Scholars take honors versions of the following courses: ECS 1100, CS 2305, CS 2340, CS 3305, CS 3341, CS 3345, CS 3354, CS 4141, CS 4337, CS 4341, CS 4348, CS 4349, CS 4384, and CS 4485.
Admission to the program is mainly by nomination and invitation. Those invited to join the Computing Scholars Honors Program will have successfully completed a full and challenging high school curriculum, will have achieved high scores on the SAT or ACT tests, and will be about to graduate from high school, or equivalent, with high class rank.
Successful participants will graduate with the added distinction of a Computing Scholars Honors Diploma.
For more information about this program students should contact the Computer Science Department leadership.

2. Curriculum Requirements can be fulfilled by other approved courses. The courses listed are recommended as the most efficient way to satisfy both Core Curriculum and Major Requirements at UT Dallas.
3. Semester credit hours fulfill the communication component of the Core Curriculum.
4. Three semester credit hours of Calculus are counted under Mathematics Core, and five semester credit hours of Calculus are counted as Component Area Option Core.
5. Six semester credit hours of Physics are counted under Science core, and one semester credit hour of Physics (PHYS 2125) is counted as Component Area Option Core.
6. Transfer students with sufficient background may petition to substitute upper-division semester credit hours in the major for this class.
7. BS in Data Science students can substitute MATH 3315 for CS 2305.
8. BS in Data Science students can substitute STAT 3355 for CS 3341.
