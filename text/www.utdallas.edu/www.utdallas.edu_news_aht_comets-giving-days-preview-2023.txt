UTD Ready To Get in the Spirit for 7th Annual Comets Giving Days

Comets Giving Days will include a photo booth at Margaret McDermott Trellis Plaza, where representatives from schools, centers and programs will gather support for their causes.
The University of Texas at Dallas community will unite with the aim of bringing good fortune to more than 120 campus groups during the seventh annual Comets Giving Days on April 19 and 20.
Looking to build on the momentum of a record-setting year in 2022, which raised more than $2.2 million from nearly 2,500 individual gifts, the University hopes to bring in more than 3,000 gifts from supporters this year and boost their impact with a variety of matching gifts and challenges.
In recognition of the “lucky No. 7” year for UT Dallas’ largest giving celebration, a $100 bonus will be awarded to the event’s 777th donor for the benefit of a favorite group. On April 19, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., faculty and staff gifts of $10 to $25 will be matched dollar for dollar for a total of $2,500. More challenges, ranging from $50 to $5,000, will support campus causes, including the Zebrafish Summer Institute, sustainability projects, academic programs, scholarships, athletics, student organizations and more.
Three student-support initiatives — UTD’s Student Emergency Financial Assistance Program, the Comet Cupboard and the Douglas Aundre Peterson Fund for Homeless Students — will challenge donors to contribute at least 50 gifts to unlock extra funding. Each program provides vital resources for students in need.
Supporters can learn about additional ways to extend their donations to campus causes on the Giving Days website.
Activities featuring free food, giveaways and photo opportunities will be held at Margaret McDermott Mall and Margaret McDermott Trellis Plaza throughout the two-day event.
All gifts made during Comets Giving Days will contribute to UT Dallas’ ongoing New Dimensions: The Campaign for UT Dallas, which aims to raise $750 million for transformative opportunities for students, research and the arts on campus.
