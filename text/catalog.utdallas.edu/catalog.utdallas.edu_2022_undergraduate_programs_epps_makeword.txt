School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences
As a collective of several disciplines, social science is the study of institutions, organizations and behavior. Social scientists ask such questions as: What roles do government, law and politics play in our society? How can public and nonprofit organizations be effectively managed? How are groups formed? How do people produce and distribute goods? Why do cities grow, and why do some cities decay? What are the causes of war, racial discrimination, and revolutions? How can we improve organizational capability in leadership and ethical decision making? Social science uses rigorous methodologies to apply ideas and theories to the real world. Degrees in the social sciences provide students with the tools of critical thinking that allow them to work and succeed in business, government, and not-for-profit organizations.
The School of Economic, Politics and Policy Sciences offers undergraduate degrees in Criminology, Economics, Geospatial Information Sciences, International Political Economy, Political Science, Public Affairs, Public Policy, and Sociology. Each degree offers a large number of elective semester credit hours that allow students to direct their educational focus. Careers building on social science degrees include law, public service, nonprofit management, finance, banking, criminal justice, human resource management, teaching, market research and analysis, urban planning, and counseling to name a few.
