UT Dallas 2021 Undergraduate Catalog
School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics
Minors
Students must take a minimum of 18 semester credit hours for the minor, 12 of which must be upper-division semester credit hours. Students who take a minor will be expected to meet the normal prerequisites in courses making up the minor, and should maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 on a 4.00 scale (C average). Semester credit hours may not be used to satisfy both the major and minor requirements; however, free elective semester credit hours or major preparatory classes may be used to satisfy the minor.
For all minors in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics students must complete all prerequisite sequences for required minor courses.
The undergraduate minors in the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics follow:

Actuarial Science
Biology
Biomolecular Structure
Chemistry
Geosciences
Mathematics
Microbiology
Molecular and Cell Biology
Neurobiology
Physics
Statistics
Secondary STEM Education

 
Minor in Actuarial Science: 24 semester credit hours
The Minor in Actuarial Science program at UT Dallas is administered through the Department of Mathematical Sciences. It is ideal for students who are interested in broadening their experience and knowledge base in the study and analysis of principles of Actuarial Science. The minor core courses prepare students for a number of actuarial exams required for a designation of Associate of the Society of Actuaries, Casualty Actuarial Society, or Canadian Institute of Actuaries. Specifically, the minor provides students with an intense background in principles of actuarial models. All of the courses in the minor serve as starting points for learning the concepts covered on the preliminary actuarial exams (P/1, FM/2, MLC/3L).
Students not majoring in Actuarial Science may obtain a minor in Actuarial Science by satisfying 24 semester credit hours (9 semester credit hours of minor core courses and 15 semester credit hours of minor preparatory courses).
Minor Preparatory Courses (15 semester credit hours)1
MATH 2417 Calculus I (or MATH 2413 Differential Calculus)
MATH 2419 Calculus II (or MATH 2414 Integral Calculus)
MATH 2451 Multivariable Calculus with Applications

2. Students whose major does not require MATH 2417 and MATH 2419 as part of their Mathematics and Component Area Option Core Curriculum Requirements, should take this sequence as their core curriculum courses to ensure efficiency toward the minor.
3. These classes prepare for the three preliminary actuarial examinations jointly administered by the Society of Actuaries (SOA), Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS), and the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA).
