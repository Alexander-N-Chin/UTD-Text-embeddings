Post-Baccalaureate Program for Teacher Certification
Teacher Development Center: Persons who already have baccalaureate degrees may seek teacher certification in all fields. They should consult with an advisor in the Teacher Development Center to develop a certification plan after they have been admitted to the University through the School of Interdisciplinary Studies as a post-baccalaureate student. Post-baccalaureate students must meet the 24 semester credit hours requirement in the appropriate teaching field. A certification plan will be developed based on an evaluation of the student's transcript. Post-baccalaureate students must demonstrate computer literacy, effective public speaking, and complete 12 semester credit hours of English. All students must fulfill the UT Dallas requirements for student teaching or supervised internship.
See the Teacher Development Center website at teach.utdallas.edu for the most current information and course requirements.
