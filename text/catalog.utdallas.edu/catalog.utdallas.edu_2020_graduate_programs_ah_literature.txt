School of Arts and Humanities
Literature
Overview
The Graduate Program in Literature brings together scholars, creative writers, and translators who share a commitment to transnational and interdisciplinary approaches to literary study and practice. The MA and Ph.D. programs provide students with a flexible context in which to pursue research across a wide range of literary traditions, critical approaches, and theoretical debates. In addition to coursework in literary studies, students have the opportunity to participate in creative writing and/or literary translation workshops as well as seminars in other disciplines, such as film studies, the history of ideas, philosophy, and the visual and performing arts.
