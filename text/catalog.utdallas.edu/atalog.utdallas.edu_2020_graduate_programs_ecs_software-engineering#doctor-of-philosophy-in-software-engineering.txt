Admission Requirements
The University's general admission requirements are discussed on the Graduate Admission page.
The student entering the Computer Science MS program should have an undergraduate preparation equivalent to a baccalaureate in a quantitative science, including calculus and linear algebra. However, special arrangements (requiring more than the minimal number of semester credit hours) can be made for students with good undergraduate preparation in other fields. Minimum requirements are:

Bachelor's degree which includes 2 semesters of calculus and 1 semester of linear algebra.
Strong foundation in programming.
A GPA (grade point average) of at least 3.0 (last 60 semester credit hours). GPA in quantitative courses of at least 3.3.
GRE revised scores of 308, 153, 155, and 4 for the combined, verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing components, respectively, are advisable based on our experience with student success in the program.

Applicants are admitted on a competitive basis.
