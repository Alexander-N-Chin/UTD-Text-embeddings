UT Dallas 2013 Graduate Catalog
Graduate Admission
Registration and Enrollment Requirements
Following the receipt of your admission letter, per State legislation effective January 1, 2012, all entering Texas college students must receive a vaccination or booster (if the vaccination is five years old) against bacterial meningitis before enrollment in accordance with Texas Education Code, Section 51.9192. Questions concerning the bacterial meningitis requirement and forms should be directed to the Office of the Registrar, 972-883-2342 or go to http://www.utdallas.edu/student/registrar.
A graduate student must be registered in any session:

during which they are taking courses, or taking examinations, required in his/her degree program.
in which he/she requires guidance in the preparation of a thesis or dissertation required in his/her degree program. Additionally, a thesis/dissertation student must complete in a total of at least three thesis or dissertation hours prior to graduating.
for at least one credit hour in the semester in which they plan to graduate. The graduating students may avail themselves of this rule only one time. Some programs may require additional semester hours.
have paid all required fees in the semester in which he/she plans to graduate.

Orientation
New student orientation sessions are designed to assist new students with an understanding of university rules and regulations and to provide information about registration procedures, academic programs, and student life. New student orientation programs are available for UT Dallas freshmen, undergraduate transfer students, graduate students, international students, and teaching and research assistants. Attendance is strongly recommended for all new students as a means of efficient matriculation into the University. International Student Orientation is mandatory for all F and J status international students. TA orientation is mandatory for all newly appointed Teaching Assistants.
Academic Good Standing
Registration in the graduate programs beyond the first semester (or summer session) is contingent on the student's being in good academic standing based on three main factors:

Satisfactory progress in meeting admission conditions that were imposed at the time of admission.
Maintenance of a 3.0 cumulative grade point average in graduate courses in the degree program.
Satisfactory progress in meeting program degree requirements.

If, at the end of a semester, a student's cumulative grade point average is below 3.0, the student will be placed on academic probation. The student must earn sufficient grade points during the next two semesters of registration to raise the cumulative grade point average to at least 3.0 exclusive of incomplete (I) grades. Failure to achieve this 3.0 cumulative grade point average will result in immediate dismissal from the University.
Continuous Enrollment
Unless on an approved leave of absence, a graduate student in a degree program must maintain continuous enrollment during the fall and spring (long session) semesters of each academic year. A graduate student who fails to register in any given long session will be permitted to re-enroll through his/her program office in any two subsequent semesters provided the student was in good academic standing at the time of last enrollment.
Registration and Readmission Requirements
A continuing student in good academic standing may register in one of three ways:

online, with the department or program office,
with the Office of the Registrar during registration, or
early to increase the probability of enrollment in available courses.

The Office of the Registrar informs the instructor of the names of all students who are officially registered and have paid all required tuition and fees in each class. It is recommended that the student confirm with the instructor that his/her registration has been properly recorded within the first week of classes. It is the student's responsibility during his/her enrolled semester that he/she is attending the correct courses for which he/she is registered. A student may not attend classes in which he/she is not registered in the above manner unless the student has been approved to audit the course.
Dates of Early, Regular and Late Registration
Registration dates and procedures are listed in the online Comet Calendar and the Academic Calendar. These online resources contains important dates and information that will be useful throughout the semester. Failure to consult and be aware of these dates and procedures does not excuse a student from information or regulations contained therein. The University reserves the right to make changes to both calendars at any time.
Paying Fees as a Part of Registration
A student is not registered or eligible to attend classes until all tuition and fees have been paid in full or until the student has arranged installment payments with the Bursar by the payment deadline in the online Comet Calendar or the Academic Calendar. If a student's registration has been canceled for nonpayment, a reinstatement fee and a late fee will be charged (see online course schedule for current fees). A student who has not completed the payment of all tuition and fees by the end of the semester will be subject to one or more of the following actions at the University's option:

bar against readmission at this institution,
withholding of grades, degree and official transcript,
all penalties and actions authorized by law.

Leave of Absence
A student who formally requests and is granted a leave of absence will be exempt from the readmission requirements. A request for a leave of absence must be made through the department or program to the Dean of Graduate Studies and is recorded on the student's academic record by the Office of the Registrar. The leave of absence does not alter the time limits placed on graduate degrees.
Readmission
A student in good academic standing who finds it necessary to suspend his/her academic activities or transfer to another institution for the duration of three long semesters (not including a summer session) must reapply to the program of intended degree. In that circumstance, a new review will be made to determine eligibility of enrollment under current standards for admission. An official transcript mailed directly by each institution attended after leaving The University of Texas at Dallas must be sent to the Office of Admission and Enrollment Services, including any transcript of attendance at another university during a summer session. If accepted, the readmitted student will be bound by the catalog in force at the time of readmission.
Beginning in the Fall 2009 semester, if a student was previously enrolled at UT Dallas, the student may be eligible to return to the University without reapplying through admissions.
To be eligible for the new policy, the student must have previously enrolled for at least one semester. A student is considered enrolled if he/she was enrolled in one or more courses after the census day for a semester. The student also must have left the University in good standing and must be in good standing with all institutions of higher education he/she formerly attended.
The following guidelines describe whether or not a student must apply or submit a re-entry form:

Previously graduate degree-seeking, returning as graduate degree-seeking - If different programs and/or different plans, must reapply and waive fee unless filing premium application - If same program, same plan, and in good standing, must submit re-entry form
Previously graduate non-degree seeking, returning as graduate degree-seeking - Must reapply and pay fee
Previously graduate degree-seeking, returning as graduate non-degree seeking - If in good standing, must submit re-entry form
Previously graduate taking undergraduate courses (GRU), coming back as graduate taking undergraduate courses (GRU) - Must submit re-entry form

If the student qualifies under the readmission policy, the student must submit a re-entry form and return it to the Office of the Registrar by the first day of class.
In addition, the student must submit official transcripts for all institutions of higher education he/she attended after last attending UT Dallas. If official transcripts are not received by Census Day, the student will be automatically dropped from any currently enrolled courses. The readmitted student may be required to submit bacterial meningitis vaccination necessary forms before being allowed to register.
Undergraduate Registration for Graduate Courses
Upper-division undergraduates who are classified as seniors may petition their Associate Dean to take graduate courses by completing the appropriate form available in the student's academic advising office. If approved, these graduate courses can be applied toward satisfying undergraduate degree requirements or can be designated for future application toward a graduate degree requirement at UT Dallas. The student must declare at the time of registration for the course, on a form provided by the Undergraduate Associate Dean, how each approved course is to be applied. Once applied, the options cannot be changed. Approvals will be subject to the conditions outlined in the following sections.
Graduate Courses Applied Toward an Undergraduate Degree
With the approval of the student's Undergraduate Associate Dean, up to 12 semester credit hours of graduate work taken as an undergraduate may be used for completing any baccalaureate degree at The University of Texas at Dallas. Pass/Fail grading for graduate courses will be permitted only in this category but must be approved by the instructor prior to the start of class.
Graduate Courses for Possible Future Use as Graduate Credit
Undergraduates may take up to 12 semester credit hours of graduate courses to reserve for possible application toward a graduate degree. To register, undergraduate students must obtain permission from the course instructor and from the graduate advisor of the program in which the course is offered. Such courses with an earned grade of 'B' or better will be eligible for application to the student's graduate record when the student is admitted to a graduate program. These courses will not apply to the student's undergraduate degree and will not affect the student's undergraduate GPA.
Graduate Courses Taken in Fast Track Options
A number of programs at The University of Texas at Dallas offer an accelerated Fast Track option that allows qualified senior undergraduate students to take specified masters level coursework. Specific admission requirements for Fast Track programs can be found within the descriptions of majors. Undergraduate students at UT Dallas who have been admitted to Fast Track programs leading to baccalaureate/master's degrees may, with the permission of the student's Undergraduate Associate Dean and the graduate advisor of the intended graduate program, take a maximum of 15 specified semester credit hours of graduate work, as a Fast Track student. The graduate hours may be used to complete the baccalaureate degree and also to satisfy requirements for the master's degree. The grade earned in the graduate coursework must be a B (3.000) or better to be applied to the master's degree requirements. A student may only Fast Track into ONE graduate program.
Graduate programs at UT Dallas may accept admission to a Fast Track program as satisfying Graduate Record Examination (GRE) criteria for admission to the graduate program. The Naveen Jindal School of Management requires students to meet its graduate admission requirements including completion of the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) prior to receiving the baccalaureate degree.
A student must be classified as a senior in order to eligible for Fast Track. Associate Deans of Undergraduate Education (ADU) determine specific eligibility to take graduate courses as evidenced by the attachment of a degree plan to the application form. The student must declare at the time of graduation on a form provided by the Undergraduate Associate Dean, how each approved graduate course is to be applied (either Fast Track or towards undergraduate degree). Once applied, the options cannot be changed.
Cooperative Arrangements
The University of Texas System
Concurrent Enrollment
A concurrent enrollment agreement is in place between The University of Texas at Dallas, The University of Texas at Arlington, and The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. This agreement allows any student enrolled concurrently between these institutions to receive a waiver of certain fees per Texas Education Code 54.011. Students must be enrolled in at least one hour at their home institution to be considered concurrently enrolled. Students must apply for concurrent enrollment with The Office of the Registrar in the Student Services Building, first floor customer service area.
Visiting Student Program
The UT System Visiting Student Program is designed to allow a graduate or professional student enrolled in an institution of the UT System to take courses or engage in research at another institution within the System during a regular semester or summer session. A UT Dallas graduate student, who has been admitted to a degree program at UT Dallas, must have completed a minimum of 15 semester credit hours at UT Dallas and be in academic good standing in order to be eligible to participate in the visiting student program. Courses to be taken under this visiting student program must have prior approval of the student's degree program advisor. An approved Leave of Absence also is required. A visiting student registers and pays tuition and required fees at his/her home institution and is given normal privileges associated with available student services at the exchange institution. A visiting student is subject to the rules and regulations of both institutions. Each UT System institution has designated an individual to coordinate and approve graduate or professional visiting students. Interested UT Dallas students should contact the Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies for additional information, 972-883-2234, or go to the Office of Graduate Studies website. A student at other UT System schools wishing to take courses at UT Dallas under this visiting student program should contact and work through the graduate dean at the home institution.
Texas A&M University System
A cooperative arrangement between The University of Texas System and the Texas A&M University System allows a graduate student at one institution to use unique facilities or courses at the other institution with a minimum of administrative paperwork. The graduate student registers and pays tuition and fees at the home institution.
Schedule Changes: Dropping, Adding and Withdrawing From Courses
Dates and time limits for schedule changes can be found in the online Comet Calendar and the Academic Calendar.
A new student seeking to drop or add courses to his/her schedule must obtain permission from his/her graduate advisor in the degree program. Drop/Add forms may be obtained from advising offices.
Drop/Adds may not be processed after Census Day. Any drops prior to and including Census Day will not show on the student's transcript. Withdrawals after Census Day will show as a W (withdraw) on the transcript.
After the last day indicated in the online Comet Calendar and the Academic Calendar for a graduate student to withdraw, the course withdrawal will be approved only on a documented emergency basis for reasons extrinsic to curricula matters. To secure such approval, the student must complete a Drop/Add form and obtain the signature of the instructor certifying that the student was passing at the time of the proposed withdrawal. The student should then submit the Drop/Add form and a written petition detailing the nature of the emergency with written documentation from employer or doctor, as appropriate, to the graduate advisor and then to the Dean of Graduate Studies. If the petition is approved, the grade assigned by the instructor on the Drop/Add form will determine the grade which will appear on the student's transcript: a passing grade will appear as a W on the transcript; a failing grade will appear as an F. Students who cease to attend classes without securing approval in the manner prescribed above will receive the grade of F for that course. Courses may not be dropped after the last day of classes in the semester.
A student who habitually withdraws from a significant fraction of his/her schedules may lose the right to withdraw or may be dismissed from the University for failure to make adequate academic progress.
Any student on a Teaching/Research Assistantship wishing to drop a course at any time during the semester must secure the signature of the Dean of Graduate Studies.
The Office of the Registrar, upon recommendation of the instructor and with the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies, may require a student to drop a course for which the student has not satisfied the prerequisite.
UT Dallas operates multiple sessions with different academic calendar and Census dates. If a student registers in a shorter session, it is the student's responsibility to review the online Comet Calendar and deadlines that affect the drop/add/withdrawal procedures. The same holds true for the summer session.
Withdrawal (Resignation) from the University
A student who wishes to withdraw entirely from the University must complete the proper withdrawal form and procedures in the Office of the Registrar. The grade assigned by the instructor on the withdrawal form will determine the grade which will appear on the student's transcript:

a passing grade will appear as a W on the transcript
a failing grade will appear as an F

Withdrawal after the final drop date requires the same procedures as listed in the previous paragraphs on Schedule Changes.
Auditing Courses
Auditing allows a student to observe the instruction of a course without earning credit. Computer Science and Engineering courses, Geoscience courses, Physical Education courses, Foreign Language courses, online courses, and any courses that charge a lab fee may not be audited. Participation and discussion is at the discretion of the instructor. Auditing grants only the privilege of hearing and observing and does not grant credit or access to online course tools.
Beginning the first day of classes through Census Day, a student may obtain an audit form in the Office of Registrar located on the first floor of the Student Services Building. Please consult http://www.utdallas.edu/student/registrar/faq.html for more detailed audit procedures and associated non-refundable fees.
All applicants for auditing graduate courses should have documentation indicating the completion of a baccalaureate degree. Exceptions to this policy may be granted only upon application to the Dean of Graduate Studies. Under no circumstances will a student be allowed to audit Studio/Ensemble courses.
Course Numbering System
All courses are identified by a four-digit number preceded by the name (or abbreviation) of the program. Courses beginning with a number 5 or greater are graduate courses. The second digit of the course number identifies the semester credit hour value. Courses with a V in the second position are variable credit hour courses.
The number of lecture hours per week and the number of laboratory hours are given in brackets following the course description: (2-4) means two hours of lecture and four hours of laboratory each week.
For additional information on semester credit hours, see policy.utdallas.edu/utdpp1090.
Frequency of Course Offerings
At the end of each course description, a frequency of course offering code is available.

S = course offered at least once each long semester
Y = course offered at least once a year
T = course offered at least once every two years
R = course offered based on student interest and instructor availability

Course Load
During each long semester, the normal course load for a full-time graduate student including those supported as a Teaching or Research Assistant is 9 semester hours.
The maximum allowed graduate course load in any given semester is 18 hours.
Registration in excess of this maximum must have the recommendation of the graduate advisor and approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and will be permitted only under exceptional circumstances.
Students who are appointed as Teaching or Research Assistants should consult with the graduate advisor or supervisor about their combined course and work load each semester.
For certification purposes, UT Dallas uses the following criteria for graduate students:

Fall/Spring Full-time status - 9 semester credit hours
Fall/Spring Half-time status - 5 semester credit hours
Summer Full-time status - 6 semester credit hours*
Summer Half-time status - 3 semester credit hours*

* Summer semester status is determined by total official enrolled hours for all the summer sessions.
Repeated Course Work
A student who wishes to repeat a course must submit a Repeated Course Adjustment form to the Graduate Dean.
Up to three graduate courses may be repeated. However, no graduate course may be repeated more than once. When a course is repeated, both grades will remain in the student's record and will be included in any transcript. The higher grade will be used in computing the grade point average or credit hours for purposes of graduation. This policy does not apply to coursework specified in the catalog that can be repeated for credit. Students are advised to check with the Office of Financial Aid to determine how and if grades earned in repeated coursework impact their financial aid eligibility status.
Final Examinations
If a final examination is given in a course, it must be given at the time scheduled by the Office of the Registrar during the final examination period. A final examination must not last more than 2 hours and 45 minutes. Students for whom three or more final examinations are scheduled in one day may petition to take the additional final examinations on different days.
Grades and Grade Point Average
The following grade scale is used in graduate coursework at the University:
  GradeDescriptionGrade Points per Semester Hour   A4.00   A-3.67   B+3.33   B3.00   B-2.67   C+2.33   C2.00   FFailure0.00   IIncomplete *   PPass *  
 * The grades of I and P do not produce grade points.
Grade of I: Incomplete
An Incomplete grade of I may be assigned, at the discretion of the instructor, for work unavoidably missed at the semester's end. The student must obtain a Grade of Incomplete/Documentation Form in the office of the student's degree program. The instructor assigning an incomplete grade must furnish a description of work required to complete the course. An incomplete must be completed eight (8) weeks from the first day of the subsequent long semester. The completed form must be signed by both the student and the instructor, and the appropriate Associate Dean, Graduate Advisor, or Department/Program Head, and must be retained with the student's academic record. If the required work to complete the course and to remove the grade of I is not submitted by the specified deadline, the grade of I is changed automatically to an F. Extension beyond the specified limit can be made only with the permission of the Dean of Graduate Studies. A student may not re-enroll in a course in which an I has already been assigned.
The instructor alone will be responsible for determining whether the requirements for completion are met and for assigning the grade in the course. If the instructor who assigned the incomplete is no longer associated with the University when the work is completed, the head of the department or program may assign a committee of appropriate faculty to evaluate the material and/or obtain any other information that may be required to assign the grade in the course. Upon completion of the evaluation of the required work, the symbol I must be converted into a letter grade (A through F or P) by the instructor, head of the department or program, or Graduate Advisor as indicated above.
Grade Changes
Faculty Initiated
After a final grade has been recorded by the Office of the Registrar, faculty may change grades only to correct a clerical error or replace a grade of incomplete. A faculty-initiated change of a final grade requires the written approval of the instructor, the department or program head, Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, and the School Dean. Such grade changes must be submitted by the end of the eighth week of the long semester after the grade was awarded. Any grade change initiated after this deadline requires the written approval of the instructor, the department or program head, the School Dean, and the Dean of Graduate Studies.
Student Request
A student has the right to request a review of the grades received in any class.
The only grounds for considering a grade to be incorrect are either clerical error or that the grade is arbitrary or capricious. Examples of clerical error would include, but are not limited to, a mistake in adding component grades, a mistake in recording grades, or attributing a paper or examination to the wrong student. "Arbitrary or capricious" means that the grade cannot be considered reasonable given the material of the course, the overall performance of the class, and the individual performance of the student. The university assumes that coursework is best evaluated by the instructor in the immediate context of the course activity. Requests for reconsideration must show with clear and convincing evidence why this assumption should be set aside.
If a student believes he or she has been assigned a grade on the basis of a clerical error or that the grade is arbitrary or capricious, the student should first seek to discuss the grade with the instructor. If this does not lead to satisfactory understanding, the student may file a formal appeal following the procedures described for academic grievances in the Rules, Regulations, and Statutory Requirements Section C (see Academic Grievances, Appendix I).
Students must petition for a grade review by the end of the eighth week of the long semester after the grade was awarded. The request must be submitted in writing to the appropriate faculty member, who then has the remainder of that semester to take action.
Pass/Fail Grading
The pass/fail option is intended to encourage a student to take courses in topics outside his/her major area where the student would be competing with a significant number of students who are majoring in these outside areas. Subject to the constraints stated below, a student may elect to take certain courses either by letter grade (A, B, C, F) or pass/fail grade (P/F). The pass/fail option should be exercised at the time of registration. In any courses in which letter grades are given to one or more students, any student wishing to take the course on a pass/fail basis must obtain the approval of the instructor and his/her graduate advisor on the Pass/Fail form. This completed form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar no later than Census Day. No change of grade designation from grade to pass/fail or pass/fail to grade can be made after the Census Day designated in the online Comet Calendar and the Academic Calendar.
A student may not elect to take the following types of courses on a pass/fail basis:

major core courses and their prerequisites required for the student's degree
elective courses in the student's major area
more than 20 percent of the hours earned at UT Dallas for any master's degree (excluding casebook, internship, practicum, independent study, research, reading, thesis or dissertation requirements)

Only pass/fail grades are given for independent study, research and reading courses, and for thesis and dissertation.
Military Service Activation Interruption of Education
From time to time, students who are reservists or members of the National Guard may be called to active duty in the U.S. military after a semester has begun. These students have several options for the treatment of their enrollment and tuition.
Option to Remain Enrolled and Complete Coursework Following Brief Military Service
Under certain circumstances, a student who is required to participate in active military service is excused from scheduled classes or other required activities and will be allowed to complete an assignment or exam within a reasonable time after the absence. The excused absence is permitted only if the student will miss no more than 25% of the total number of class meetings or the contact hour equivalent (not including the final examination period) for the specific course or courses in which the student is enrolled at the beginning of the period of active military service.
Option to Withdraw, Receive Incomplete Grade, or Receive Final Grade
A reservist or member of the National Guard called to active duty in the U.S. military who receives activation orders after the start of a semester has four other options for the treatment of tuition and fees paid to The University of Texas at Dallas and transcript notation. In accordance with Texas statutes and Coordinating Board rules, the student may request any one of the following:

The Office of the Registrar will process the withdrawal of the student from all classes and record "Withdrawn-Called to Military Duty" (WM) on the student's transcript and the Bursar Office shall refund the tuition and fees paid by the student for the semester in which the student withdraws; or
The Office of the Registrar may grant a student who is eligible under UT Dallas guidelines an incomplete grade (see "Incomplete Grades" section of the catalog for eligibility) in all courses by designating "Incomplete-Called to Military Duty" (XM) on the student's transcript. Please note: XM grades must be resolved within one year from the "release from active duty" date on military orders; or
The student may petition the instructor to assign an appropriate final grade or credit for the course after successfully completing a substantial amount of coursework and having demonstrated sufficient mastery of the course material; or
If the student withdraws before the Census Day of the semester in which the student is called to active military duty and the student requests Military Leave, courses will be dropped. Courses dropped on or before Census Day will not appear on the student's transcript.

NOTE: There are no provisions for refunds for active duty service members who are deployed as a result of military orders or for individuals who choose to enter the service. The provisions listed above apply only to reservists or members of the National Guard called to active duty.
Readmission Following Military Service
The University of Texas at Dallas will grant readmission to any veteran who was previously offered admission in a graduate program at the University, but could not enroll or had to withdraw due to deployment as a member of the United States Armed Forces or the Texas National Guard (not including routine Texas National Guard training). The graduate program must grant credit for previous coursework and accept standardized test scores regardless of the time since the veteran was initially offered admission.
If the student was enrolled in classes at the University when called to active duty in the United States Armed Forces or the Texas National Guard (not including routine Texas National Guard training), the student shall be readmitted without reapplication or payment of additional application fees within one year of the "release from active duty" date on the student´s military orders. An eligible student will retain prior academic standing, course credits awarded and financial eligibility if the student meets current eligibility requirements other than continuous enrollment or other timing requirements.
Change of Address, Email, or Name
Students may complete a change of address online through Galaxy. Students must maintain home and mail addresses and telephone numbers using Galaxy. Although the UT Dallas administration and faculty primarily utilize UT Dallas email for communications, UT Dallas sends certain academic and financial communications through the mail. Therefore, if a student fails to maintain a current address, the student will be responsible for correspondence that is undeliverable.
Students may complete a change of personal email online through Galaxy. A student's UT Dallas email address is the official method of communication between faculty, administration, and the student. A UT Dallas student must maintain his/her UT Dallas email account at all times. Therefore, if a student fails to maintain their UT Dallas email account, the student will be responsible for correspondence that is undeliverable.
Students may complete a "Name Change Request" form at http://www.utdallas.edu/student/registrar/forms and submit in person to The Office of the Registrar in the Student Services Building, first floor customer service area. A copy of the student's driver's license, a marriage certificate, or court order used as proof of the name change must accompany the name change request.
Religious Holy Days
The University of Texas at Dallas will excuse a student from class or other required activities, including examinations, for the travel to and observance of a religious holy day for a religion whose places of worship are exempt from property tax under Section 11.20,  Tax Code, Texas Code Annotated.
The student is encouraged to notify the instructor or activity sponsor as soon as possible regarding the absence, preferably in advance of the assignment.
The student, so excused, will be allowed to take the exam or complete the assignment within a reasonable time after the absence: a period equal to the length of the absence, up to a maximum of one week. A student who notifies the instructor and completes any missed exam or assignment may not be penalized for the absence. A student who fails to complete the exam or assignment within the prescribed period may receive a failing grade for that exam or assignment.
If a student or an instructor disagrees about the nature of the absence [i.e., for the purpose of observing a religious holy day] or if there is similar disagreement about whether the student has been given a reasonable time to complete any missed assignments or examinations, either the student or the instructor may request a ruling from the President of UT Dallas, or his or her designee. The chief executive officer or designee must take into account the legislative intent of TEC 51.911(b), and the student and instructor will abide by the decision of the chief executive officer or designee.
