UT Dallas 2022 Undergraduate Catalog
Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science
Minors
Students must take a minimum of 18 semester credit hours for the minor, 12 of which must be upper-division semester credit hours. Students who take a minor will be expected to meet the normal prerequisites in courses making up the minor, and should maintain a minimum GPA of 2.000 on a 4.00 scale (C average). Semester credit hours may not be used to satisfy both the major and minor requirements; however, free elective semester credit hours or major preparatory classes may be used to satisfy the minor. Core courses offered by the school may count as lower-division semester credit hours toward the minor. Topics courses must be approved by the school.
The undergraduate minors in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science are the following:

Minor in Nanoscience and Technology
18 semester credit hours
Goals for the Minor in Nanoscience and Technology
As the field of nanotechnology develops further, particularly in the north Texas region, The University of Texas at Dallas has an important role to play in the education of knowledge workers for the industry. The Minor in Nanoscience and Technology offered by the Department of Materials Science and Technology provides a means for undergraduate students to familiarize themselves with the concepts and principles of nanotechnology.
This minor has been designed around three core MSEN designated courses, the content of which is exclusively related to Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. The remaining nine semester credit hours of courses may be chosen from the list of courses below.
The contents of the courses BIOL 4461, CHEM 3322, and PHYS 4301 are similar enough that only one of these three courses may count toward the minor. In addition, several lower-division electives have been included to provide streamlined access to the available upper-division electives.
Since the three core courses are all upper-division electives, only one of the remaining nine semester credit hours must be an upper-division course, although students may choose to challenge themselves by pursuing all nine semester credit hours as upper-division electives.
Educational Objectives for the Minor in Nanoscience and Technology On completion of the Minor program, students will:

Have a comprehensive general education background
Have a working knowledge of nanotechnology and nanoscience principles and industry applications
Be able to apply key concepts in materials science, chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering to the field of nanotechnology
Understand the societal and technology issues that may impede the adoption of nanotechnology
Have the ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively
Be able to become successful professionals and, if they desire, be able to pursue graduate study
Be able to identify career paths and requisite knowledge and skills for career change towards nanotechnology

Requirements for the Minor in Nanoscience and Technology
A total of 18 semester credit hours are required, consisting of three core classes (9 semester credit hours) and 9 additional semester credit hours of electives.
I. Core Requirements: 9 semester credit hours
MSEN 3301 Introduction to Nanoscience and Nanotechnology
MSEN 3302 Microscopy, Spectroscopy, and Nanotech Instrumentation
MSEN 4V95 Undergraduate Research (in Nanotechnology)
II. Elective Requirements: 9 semester credit hours
Students must complete at least nine semester credit hours chosen from the following courses. At least one of the courses must be upper-division (3000 or 4000):
MSEN-designated courses:
MSEN 3310 Introduction to Materials Science
MSEN 4391 or EE 4391 Technology of Plasma
MSEN 4V95 Undergraduate Research (in Nanotechnology)
Lower-division courses:
CHEM 2323 Introductory Organic Chemistry I
CHEM 2325 Introductory Organic Chemistry II
PHYS 2303 Contemporary Physics
MECH 2320 Mechanics of Materials
Upper-division courses:
PHYS 4352 Concepts of Modern Physics
MECH 4360 Introduction to Nanostructured Materials
MECH 4370 Introduction to MEMS
EE 3310 Electronic Devices
EE 3311 Electronic Circuits
CHEM 4335 Polymer Chemistry
CHEM 3472 Instrumental Analysis
CHEM 4473 Physical Measurements Laboratory
CHEM 3321 Physical Chemistry I
CHEM 4355 Computational Modeling
Only one of the following courses may be used to count toward the Minor:
BIOL 4461 Biophysical Chemistry
CHEM 3322 Physical Chemistry II
PHYS 4301 Quantum Mechanics I
