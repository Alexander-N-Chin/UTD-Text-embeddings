UT Dallas 2020 Undergraduate CatalogPHYS2421 - Honors Physics I - Mechanics and HeatPHYS 2421 Honors Physics I - Mechanics and Heat (4 semester credit hours) Calculus-based physics. This class is a more rigorous version of PHYS 2325 with additional topics in thermal physics. Derivations are more general and rely more heavily on calculus and the use of vectors. More challenging problems and applications. A laboratory component has been integrated directly into the course. Laboratory topics include statistical and systematic uncertainty, multivariate error propagation, calibration, and experiments with an accelerometer. Prerequisite: MATH 2413 or MATH 2417 with a minimum grade of B+ in either course. Corequisites: (MATH 2414 or MATH 2419). (3-1) Y
