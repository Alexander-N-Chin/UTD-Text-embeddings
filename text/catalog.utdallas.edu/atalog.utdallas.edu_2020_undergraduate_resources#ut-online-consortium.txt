Mandatory Tuberculosis Screening for International Students

Tuberculosis (TB) screening is required for all persons born outside the United States, regardless of the status of their application. (Note: Being granted the resident tuition rate does NOT exempt an international student from this requirement.)
Screening for TB must be administered, regardless of prior BCG vaccination, no more than (6) months prior to the first day of class.
The only acceptable TB screening options are the Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) blood test and T-Spot. A TB skin test will NOT be accepted.
The T-Spot or IGRA blood test must be administered and interpreted in the United States by a licensed medical provider.
International students who do not complete a TB screening will NOT be allowed to register for classes.
The T-Spot test is available through the on-campus Student Health Center at a reasonable cost.
TB holds will be released by 8:00 a.m. the following day after the T-Spot (TB screening) test has been administered. At this time students will be able to register for classes. Results of the T-Spot test will be available four business days after the test is administered. If a T-Spot result is positive, the student will be contacted by the Student Health Center. A hold will be placed on the student's account until a follow-up visit is conducted with the Student Health Center to administer additional required testing/screenings. During this time, students will not be permitted to attend classes. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action. This hold may prevent students from registering for future classes, receiving grades, and possibly receiving a degree.

Appropriate documentation secured from a U.S. licensed medical provider may be sent to the following address:
Student Health Center, SSB 43  The University of Texas at Dallas  800 West Campbell Road  Richardson, TX 75080-3021
