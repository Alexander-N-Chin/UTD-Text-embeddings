UT Dallas 2022 Undergraduate Catalog
Undergraduate Policies and Procedures
Admission Policies
Credit by Examination (AP, CLEP, IB)
Credit by examination is through such testing programs as the Advanced Placement Program (AP), the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), and the International Baccalaureate (IB). Students petition for credit by examination. First year students must see their academic advisor to determine the best application of examination credit. As credit is petitioned after admission, credit by examination is not considered as part of an applicant's transferable GPA or transfer hours for admissions.
Petitioning examination of credit should be completed within the student's first term at UT Dallas, but not later than the first day of the student's graduating term. A first year student must weigh the advantages of accepting college credit through examinations against the possible impact such credit might have on tuition rebate eligibility and their readiness for subsequent courses in an academic sequence. Guidelines for credit by examinations are available on the UT Dallas website at oue.utdallas.edu and/or at the UT Dallas Office of Admission and Enrollment website (enroll.utdallas.edu/transfer/transfer-credit).
Exams ten years and older will not be considered for credit. UT Dallas must receive an official score report from the testing agency that provided the examination. UT Dallas does not accept examination credit from other higher education institutions' transcripts.
Criminal Background Check
Certain programs require students to submit to and satisfactorily complete a background check review as a condition of admission and/or participation in education experiences. Students who refuse to submit to a background check or who do not pass the background check may be dismissed from the program. The student is responsible for the costs associated with the criminal background check.
Admission Criteria for First-Time in College Freshmen
Automatic Admission
In accordance with Section 51.803 of the Texas Education Code, students are automatically admitted to the University as first-time freshmen if they graduate in the top 10% of their class from an accredited Texas high school, and, in accordance with Section 28.025 of the Texas Education Code, successfully complete the Distinguished Level of Achievement, as applicable. Applicants must have graduated from high school during one of the two school years preceding the academic year for which they seek admission as first-time freshmen and have not attempted any higher education credits since graduation from high school. Pursuant to Texas Education Code, Sections 51.803 and 51.805, and high school applicants have met one of the following conditions:

successfully completed the distinguished level of achievement under the Foundation Program from a Texas public high school;
successfully completed a curriculum from a high school in Texas other than a public school that is equivalent in content and rigor to the distinguished level of achievement under the Foundation High School Program;
satisfied ACT's College Readiness Benchmarks on the ACT assessment, or
earned on the College Board's SAT assessment a score of at least 1,500 out of 2,400 or the equivalent

Meeting the minimum requirements makes a student eligible for automatic admission but exceeding the minimum is often necessary for applicants to be competitive to the many of the University's academic programs. The high school curriculum requirements will be documented through the application process. Applicants admitted because they are in the top 10% of their high school class may be required to complete additional preparatory work before enrolling in the University or complete developmental coursework to remove any deficiencies in their readiness to successfully complete college-level work prior to University graduation.
Reviewed Admission
All applications from students who do not meet the Automatic Admission Criteria will be reviewed holistically. Applicants must have graduated from an accredited high school or satisfied the equivalent requirements, and should have completed the high school credit requirements listed below (see item 9). Admission decisions are based on the applicant's composite achievement profile, including:

High school class rank and GPA (grade point average)
Strength of academic preparation including the number and complexity of courses taken (honors, AP, IB, etc.)
SAT-I or ACT scores
Record of achievements, honors, and awards
Special accomplishments, work, and community service, both in and out of school
Essays
Special circumstances that put academic achievements in context
Recommendation letters (suggested, but not required, and limited to up to three submitted through the application process)

Successful completion of a high school curriculum that includes:

Four credits of English Language Arts, including at least one credit of writing skills
Two credits of a single language other than English (three credits recommended)
Four credits of Mathematics, including Algebra II and including a course dealing with trigonometry, such as pre-calculus
Four credits of Science
Three credits of Social Sciences, not including work-study (four credits recommended)
One credit of Fine Arts

In addition to current University requirements for admission, applicants must also have either:

Successfully completed the curriculum requirements for the Distinguished Level of Achievement or its equivalent, or
Satisfied ACT's College Readiness Benchmark assessment or College Board's SAT Benchmark assessment as outlined in the set of conditions within the Automatic Admission Criteria section.

The above requirement may be satisfied if the applicant's official high school transcript or diploma states that the applicant completed the portion of the recommended or advanced curriculum or its equivalent that was available to the applicant, but was unable to complete the remainder of the curriculum solely because courses necessary to complete the remainder were unavailable to the applicant at the appropriate times in the applicant's high school career as a result of course scheduling, lack of enrollment capacity, or another cause not within the applicant's control.
Students outside the State of Texas will be considered for admission based on the same academic benchmarks listed above and a comparable high school curriculum.
Admission Criteria for Transfer Students
Automatic Admission
Section 51.8035 of the Texas Education Code establishes criteria for automatic admission to The University of Texas at Dallas for eligible transfer students who began their studies at a Texas institution of higher education following high school graduation.
To be eligible for automatic transfer admission under section 51.8035, a prospective transfer student must have:

Qualified for automatic admission to a Texas institution of higher education at the time he or she graduated from high school, or was previously offered admission under this provision, Texas Education Code, Section 51.803.
First enrolled in a public junior college or other public or private lower-division institution of higher education not earlier than the third academic year before the academic year for which he or she is seeking admission to the University.
Completed the core curriculum at a public junior college or other public or private lower-division institution of higher education with a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 2.500 on a 4.000 point scale, or the equivalent.
Submitted a complete application for transfer admission by the deadline.

To take advantage of the automatic admission option, the applicant must submit to UT Dallas, by the deadline, information that "expressly and clearly" claims entitlement to admission under this provision.
Application of Transfer Credit
The University may accept transfer credit only for academic post-secondary coursework completed with a grade of C (2.000 on a 4.000 point scale) or higher. The University of Texas at Dallas does not offer credit for developmental or remedial studies, nor does it grant credit for prior experiential learning. Some degree programs offer credit for applied sciences and applied technology coursework. Please note: if a student transfers majors at UT Dallas, some transfer credits from applied sciences and applied technology degrees might not be applicable to the new major. Coursework that is accepted for transfer credit is applicable toward satisfying requirements for a specific UT Dallas major according to the same criteria as those used for equivalent UT Dallas courses. For more information please go to Transfer Disputes for Lower-Division Courses.
Prospective transfer students from Texas community colleges should refer to the UT Dallas Transfer Plans and visit their community college academic advising offices to learn more about curricula appropriate to the various UT Dallas majors.
As soon as an application for admission, transcripts and any required test scores have been received, the Office of the Registrar will evaluate the student's record to determine which credits earned at another domestic college or university will transfer to UT Dallas. The Office of Admission and Enrollment will evaluate the student's record to determine which credits earned at another international college or university will transfer to UT Dallas.
The application of transfer credit to degree plans must be completed within the first semester of enrollment. An undergraduate advisor in the student's major, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education, will determine how the transfer credits apply towards UT Dallas degree requirements. The faculty, acting through the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education, has the ultimate responsibility for applying transfer credit to their specific major requirements. Students are urged to contact their advising office upon receipt of the letter informing them of their admission to UT Dallas.
Transfer students who begin their semester with 45 or more semester credit hours are required to file a degree plan with UT Dallas no later than the end of the student's regular semester in accordance with Texas Education Code, Section 51.9685, subsection C.
Applicants seeking admission to UT Dallas should be aware that they will need at least 51 upper-division semester credit hours to graduate (see "Graduation Requirements").
Transfer Admission Criteria
Transfer applicants must submit transcripts from all college/universities attended for admission review. Transfer applicants with a freshman classification (see "Classification of Students") may be required to submit official high school transcripts and SAT/ACT scores as well as all college level coursework. Transfer applicants, with a higher classification, will be reviewed on their cumulative transfer GPA of post-secondary academic coursework and a review of specific college courses only. Additionally, they are subject to compliance to the Texas Success Initiative (TSI) pursuant to Texas Administrative Code, Title 19, Part 1, Chapter 4, Subchapter C, Rule 4.54.   
Assured Admission
Applicants with 42 or more transferable semester credit hours must meet the following admission criteria:

 Have a minimum cumulative transferable GPA of 3.000 on a 4.000 point scale
 Be in good standing from the last college or university attended
 Have fewer than 90 attempted semester credit hours at a Texas public institution of higher education

Reviewed Admission
Transfer applicants who do not meet the assured transfer admission criteria will be reviewed and may be placed on probation.

If you are a student with a TSI Hold on your record, it must be removed prior to registering for courses. Contact an academic advisor in your program for more information.
Developmental Education at UT Dallas
Students who are required to take the TSI Assessment and do not score at the college readiness levels will be required to register for Developmental Education courses for all areas in which they did not achieve the stated cut-score. UT Dallas does not offer Developmental Education coursework, so registration for Developmental Education can be done at a community college of the students' choosing. Students must work with their UT Dallas School academic advisor and the UT Dallas TSI coordinator to ensure they are properly enrolled in courses at UT Dallas as well as Developmental Education courses at a local community college. If at any time during the semester a student is in violation of this policy, the student may be dropped from their UTD course(s). Note: UTD requires students be TSI complete prior to upper lever coursework beyond 59 credit hours.
Placement and Enrollment into Developmental Education
UT Dallas students may enroll in Developmental Education courses at a local community college of their choosing. Students should discuss this with their UT Dallas School academic advisor and the UT Dallas TSI coordinator. Students are required to successfully complete the developmental coursework sequence at the community college to become TSI complete. A student can only become TSI complete if they have completed the highest level of the developmental education coursework at the community college or until they reach the college-ready standard on the TSI Assessment.
