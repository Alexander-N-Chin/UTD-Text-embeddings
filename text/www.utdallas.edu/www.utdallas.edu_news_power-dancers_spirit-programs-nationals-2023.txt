Spirit Squads Soar with Stellar Showings at National Championships

Members of the UT Dallas spirit programs — the Cheerleaders, Power Dancers and UTD mascot Temoc — celebrated after their recent performances at national championship events in Florida.
The University of Texas at Dallas Power Dancers got a leg up over their rivals to win a pair of titles for the first time at the National Cheerleaders Association & National Dance Alliance Collegiate Cheer and Dance Championships.
The Comets won both the Dance Spirit Rally and the Team Performance categories in the open division at the competition, which was held April 5-9 in Daytona, Florida.
Miguel Hernandez, UT Dallas spirit programs coordinator and Power Dancers coach, said the wins didn’t come easily as the team had to overcome injuries and some turnover on the roster this year.
“One of the challenges was having some of the dancers who weren’t in the routines initially to step up and get into that spot,” he said. “The hardest part was having to move people around all the way up until right before we stepped on the stage.”
“There are a ton of people who go to UTD who don’t know we have dance, cheer and mascot teams. I’m hoping this is what puts us on the map in terms of recruiting.”

Hernandez credited the team’s success to the early preparation for the season after last year’s two second-place finishes at nationals.
“As soon as we left nationals in 2022, I already knew what we were doing next year. I already had the themes in my head, already had the costume idea as we were in the airport. I knew it was the year for us,” he said.
Meanwhile, the UT Dallas Cheerleaders placed third among Division III intermediate small coed squads at Daytona, and UTD mascot Temoc placed fourth among collegiate mascots at the Dance Team Union’s College Classic on April 6-8 in Orlando, Florida. Temoc competed with the Power Dancers for the first time in Daytona and also was part of one of the team’s winning routines.
Haiden Herring, the UT Dallas cheer coach, said her team also had to overcome challenges this year.
“We battled injuries and a small team size. With a small team, each athlete has to perform multiple skills throughout a routine to maximize our score sheet. That leads to a higher chance of injury,” she said.
“As a coach, it was a joy to see our athletes come together as a team and feel accomplished. We are a small team with a big heart,” Herring said.
Hernandez hopes the groups’ performances will encourage more people to join and to support the spirit teams.
“There are a ton of people who go to UTD who don’t know we have dance, cheer and mascot teams,” he said. “I’m hoping this is what puts us on the map in terms of recruiting.”
Hernandez said the Power Dancers’ victories mean other teams will be nipping at their heels next year.
“Once you have won two titles, that’s pressure. But luckily, I think with pressure comes diamonds,” he said.
