About the Graduate Catalog
The University of Texas at Dallas Graduate Online Catalog is the document of authority for all students, faculty, and staff. The catalog reflects current academic policies, procedures, degree offerings, course descriptions, and other information pertinent to graduate study at The University of Texas at Dallas. It is not intended to, nor does it contain, all regulations that relate to students. The provisions of this catalog do not constitute a contract, express or implied, between any applicant, student, or faculty member and The University of Texas at Dallas or The University of Texas System.
Students are governed by the catalog under which they were enrolled or, at a student's option, the catalog of any subsequent year in which that student was in residence. Please refer to the academic requirements and procedures sections for more information.
While every effort has been made to make this catalog as complete and accurate as possible, The University of Texas at Dallas reserves the right to change the provisions of this catalog at any time, including, but not limited to: withdraw courses at any time, to change fees or tuition, calendar, curriculum, course offerings, degree requirements, graduation procedures, and any other requirements affecting students as necessitated by university, legislative or regental action. Changes will become effective whenever the proper authorities so determine and will apply to both prospective students and those already enrolled.
Students are held individually responsible for complying with all requirements of the rules and regulations of the University and the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System. Failure to read and comply with policies, regulations, and procedures will not exempt a student from whatever penalties the student may incur from a lack of compliance. Many departments and programs issue program manuals, procedures and policy manuals, handbooks, and other informational publications for students and faculty in its programs. These publications provide detailed and useful information; however, they are not statements of official policy or binding contracts of The University of Texas at Dallas or of The University of Texas System. In all matters, the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, the Handbook of Operating Procedures of The University of Texas at Dallas, and the Graduate Catalog of The University of Texas at Dallas shall supersede departmental, program, or college publications.
The online version of The University of Texas at Dallas Graduate Catalog is the official version. The online catalog will be updated periodically and will contain all major approved policy changes that occur during the 2020-2021 catalog cycle. The official publication date of this catalog is June 2020.
