Education (BA, BS)
UT Dallas offers both a Bachelor of Arts in Education degree (BAED) and a Bachelor of Science in Education degree (BSED) through the School of Interdisciplinary Studies. Each degree emphasizes a broader understanding and wider perspective of the field of education. Becoming a teacher takes preparation and planning.

The TDC interfaces and engages with all academic schools at UT Dallas, as well as 22 area school districts, to assist students as they progress through the Teacher Certification Program.
