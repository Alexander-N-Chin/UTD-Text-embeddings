Visual and Performing Arts (BA) - Film Concentration (Print Version)









UT Dallas 2021 Undergraduate Catalog
School of Arts and Humanities
Visual and Performing Arts with Film Concentration (BA)
Students who complete the major in Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) pursue an interdisciplinary study of the arts by completing a major core that includes courses in writing, interdisciplinary studies, professional development, historical context, theory, and practice. The VPA major culminates in a Senior Capstone. Students who are majoring in VPA can focus their studies by choosing from nine possible concentrations.
Film Studies is an interdisciplinary academic field that considers the history, aesthetics, and ideology of cinema as an art form, as an industry, and as a system of personal, political, and cultural representation. Courses are offered on a variety of topics involving film and moving-image culture, among them authorship, adaptation, world and national cinemas, genres (such as comedy, the musical, horror, and science fiction), and modes (such as documentary, experimental cinema, and film noir).
Since the following catalog course descriptions are very general, students are urged to consult the detailed course descriptions available on the web site for the School of Arts and Humanities. At least one-half of the total semester credit hours for major requirements must be taken at UT Dallas.
Unless otherwise noted, courses in Visual and Performing Arts are open to all students in the University.
